1. Draft a specific aims page (2 pages maximum) of your proposed study. Consistent with most well-written D&I-focused specific aims pages, it should generally address the following 5 elements (and questions): 

Title: Improving patient safety by promoting guideline-concordant proton pump inhibitor use: a multi-site de-implementation study

Health problem
Three out of every five prescriptions for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in hospitalized non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) patients are not guideline concordant.1,2 These stomach acid suppressing medications have been associated with a 25% increase in mortality risk and they cost the US healthcare system over 11 billion dollars annually.3,4 Initially perceived to be harmless, evidence is mounting that PPI use is associated with serious adverse effects such as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), pneumonia, bone fractures, reduced serum magnesium, kidney disease and vitamin B12 deficiency.5-11 

Current state of the field on de-implementing PPIs
We conducted a systematic literature review and identified four studies that examined de-implementation of PPIs.33-36 Two of these studies were conducted in the primary care setting which is not applicable to the acute care setting of our proposed study.33,34 Among the remaining two, a study by Michal et al in adult non-ICU hospitalized patients found that pharmacists’ review of PPIs and recommendation to physicians led to a 25% decrease in PPI prescriptions.35 However, the intervention period was only one month and it was performed in a non-VA setting. The results of this study, do however, support further assessment as is proposed in this application. In another study conducted in a VA medical facility, pharmacists assessed the need for PPI continuation daily during hospitalization for all patients who were on PPI therapy pre-admission. If the patient did not meet the criteria, PPIs were discontinued and patients were switched to other acid suppressive therapy on an as-needed basis. However, this study provided intervention implementation strategies, but did not report patient or intervention outcomes. 36 No prior study has involved patients in designing the intervention; using our existing patient engagement panel, our pilot study will incorporate patient perspectives on PPI use which will help refine the intervention. 

Dissemination or implementation gap
Professional society guidelines define concordant PPI prescriptions as those prescribed in the right dose and duration for the recommended indication. PPIs are appropriately prescribed for conditions such as esophageal ulcers, gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, peptic ulcers, gastroduodenal ulcers, Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal reflux.12,13 Although useful in preventing gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulceration in critically ill patients,14 there is no evidence showing benefit to using PPIs for prophylaxis in medical non-ICU inpatients and thus their use is not recommended.15 However, nonconcordant PPI prescription practices in non-ICU settings are widespread, with a study of 946 patients conducted in a VA hospital showing that guideline-concordant PPI prescription occurred in only 35% of patients on PPIs.12 Nonconcordant PPI use has substantial economic consequences; a VA study in the primary care setting showed that the total annual cost of nonconcordant PPIs was $1,566,252. Why nonconcordant prescribing and use of PPIs persists is likely due to many factors, complicated by the fact that PPIs are available over the counter. Many of the side effects of PPIs may take a long time (months to years) to manifest,16,17 making it difficult for clinicians or patients to connect the adverse effects to the PPI. Even when clinicians are cognizant of PPI overuse, concerns about adverse effects and cost may not be top of mind for them.18 De-implementation of PPIs thus remains a major gap that needs to be addressed. 

The long-term goal of our work is to reduce nonconcordant PPI use and improve associated outcomes, such as reduction in CDI. The objective in this proposal is to implement an intervention that will promote guideline-concordant PPI use among hospitalized non-ICU patients. The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS 2.0) model will be used to implement and evaluate a PPI de-implementation intervention.19 The SEIPS model describes five elements of the system that can affect processes and outcomes: (1) people, (2) tasks, (3) tools and technologies, (4) organization, and (5) environment. This allows for a complete assessment of context, “characteristics of the organization and its environment that influence implementation of an intervention.” 20 The intervention will leverage existing antibiotic stewardship (AS) programs to undertake prospective audit and feedback of PPI use. The rationale for selection of this approach is that PPI de-implementation shares a common goal with AS with regards to CDI reduction. Therefore, it is plausible and naturally fitting to embed a PPI de-implementation intervention in an existing AS Program. The proposed study will be informed by a funded pilot study to assess feasibility. The pilot will 1) provide data about the feasibility of incorporating a PPI stewardship intervention in an existing AS program, and 2) assess the acceptability of such an intervention by all involved stakeholders including prescribing clinicians, the AS team and patients. 

Specific aims

Aim 1. Assess the effect of the intervention on concordant PPI use as well as clinical infectious and non-infectious outcomes. 
Throughout the control and intervention periods of the study, we will collect data on de-implementation (proportion of patients with reduced or discontinued dose), and data on clinical outcomes such as CDI and pneumonia. We will analyze these data using an Interrupted time series (ITS) design.

Aim 1a. Evaluate the fidelity to the intervention by providers who include physicians, nurse practitioners,    and physician assistants. 
We will use a five-item tool (exposure, quality of the delivery, participant responsiveness, program differentiation and intervention adherence), 21,22 that will be adapted to the study.

Aim 2. Assess the drug costs (both PPIs and antibiotics used to treat CDI) averted by the intervention. 
We will assess the costs of drugs averted by the intervention by conducting a budget-impact analysis comparing the cost of medication during the control and intervention periods.23 This will be accomplished using a multivariate logistic regression analysis with a log of total hospital drug costs (both PPIs and antibiotics used to treat CDI) as the dependent variable, with period (control or intervention) as the predictor variable, and adjust for all relevant covariates

Aim 3. Create a VA PPI de-implementation toolkit to provide concrete PPI de-implementation approaches that can potentially be applied to other over-prescribed medications. 

Aim 3a. Assess barriers to the de-implementation of nonconcordant PPI use.
Aim3 & 3a will be accomplished by assessing barriers to de-implementing non-concordant PPI use through individual interviews and focus group discussions of all involved stakeholders such as physicians and other clinicians like physician assistants. 

Importance to field
This study will provide ways of how to successfully de-implement a non-guideline concordant clinical practice. The work proposed is innovative in that we will harness the existing AS program to roll out a PPI stewardship

Title: Implementing a Standardized Approach for Dosing and Progressing Intensity of Physical Therapy Interventions in the Home Health Setting

Specific Aims
Standardized approaches to dosing and progressing the intensity (i.e., physical exertion) of physical therapy interventions in the home health care setting are not routinely used. The importance of providing appropriately dosed intensity of interventions is established,1-5 and it is possible to reach beneficial levels of intensity through functional task practice.6 Under-dosed intensity of strength training during physical therapy is included in the Choosing Wisely initiative as one of the “Five Things Physical Therapists and Patients Should Question”.7 Home health care is under increasing pressure to improve patient outcomes and reduce variations in practice.8,9  National, risk-adjusted data indicates there is variability in patients’ functional outcomes across home health agencies and opportunities for improvement.8,9 Individualized, real-time prescription of intensity ensures activities are not under-dosed or alternatively medically unsafe. The need to develop effective strategies for implementing standardized approaches to dosing and progressing the intensity of physical therapy interventions in the home health setting is an addressable gap in rehabilitative care.

The purpose of the proposed study is to integrate a standardized approach to dosing and progressing the intensity of physical therapy interventions in the home health setting to allow for more informed, patient-centered clinical decision-making and optimize patient outcomes. We hypothesize that the systematic development and implementation of multifaceted strategies will facilitate adoption of and fidelity to the standardized approach and will result in a sustainable aspect of care that improves patients’ home health physical therapy outcomes. We will use a prospective effectiveness-implementation hybrid design with quantitative and qualitative data collection to address the study aims.10 The project will include pre-implementation (6 months), facilitated implementation (1 year), and sustainability (1 year) phases. The proposed project represents a clinical-academic partnership between the Medical University of South Carolina and a national home health agency. The project is also the research plan of a Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award (K01). The aims and methodology align with the training plan. The overarching goal of the K01 application is to allow Addie Middleton, PhD, DPT, an early career investigator, to develop independence in dissemination and implementation (D&I) research. Dr. Middleton has partnered with a national home health agency and established D&I researchers to achieve the following aims:

Aim 1. Identify the multifaceted implementation strategies that maximize therapists’ adoption of and adherence to a standardized approach for dosing and progressing the intensity of activities during home health sessions. We will conduct semi-structured key informant interviews every 3 months over the pre- and facilitated implementation phases with the 20(?) therapists randomized to the standardized approach. We will use the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify barriers and facilitators, determine the behavior change techniques that can be used to address the barriers, and map the behavior change techniques to implementation strategies.11,12 Hypothesis: Systematically developed, tailored implementation strategies to overcome barriers and leverage facilitators will increase therapists’ adoption of and adherence to a standardized approach for dosing and progressing intensity over one year of facilitated implementation.

Aim 2. Determine the impact of a standardized approach for dosing and progressing activities during home health physical therapy sessions on patients’ functional and satisfaction outcomes. We will compare risk-adjusted functional and satisfaction outcomes between patients treated by therapists randomized to the standardized approach and patients treated by control therapists over the final six months of the facilitated implementation phase. Hypothesis: Outcomes will be superior among patients treated by therapists randomized to the standardized approach compared to patients treated by control therapists.

Aim 3. Determine the factors that impact sustainability of a standardized approach for dosing and progressing the intensity of physical therapy interventions in the home health setting. We will conduct semi-structured key informant interviews with administrators and participating therapists to identify the barriers to and facilitators of sustainability of the standardized approach over the one year after the facilitated implementation phase ends. Hypothesis: Patient, therapist, organizational, and policy factors will be identified that positively and negatively impact sustainability.

The proposed project leverages a clinical-academic partnership to improve home health physical therapy care by ensuring patients receive optimal intervention intensity, a critical ingredient of patients’ functional recovery, and by reducing unwarranted variation in care delivery. Our application of measurement-based care is innovative in this setting, and we expect to generate generalizable knowledge for future implementation efforts focused on home health physical therapy care. The proposed project is also foundational for Dr. Middleton’s long-term career objectives: 1) collaborate with investigators and clinical partners to translate evidence-based practices into rehabilitative care; 2) bring a D&I perspective to later phase clinical trials to maximize efficiency of translation to rehabilitative care, and 3) mentor junior investigators interested in rehabilitation-related D&I research. The expertise of the mentoring team, combined with the training plan, will allow Dr. Middleton to develop skills to successfully conduct the proposed project and to launch an independent D&I research program.

Background and Specific Aims
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.1 A common manifestation of CAD is acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which includes ST-Elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as well as non-ST-Elevation MI and unstable angina (i.e., NSTE-ACS). ACS is associated with an in-hospital mortality rate as high as 10%.2 Accordingly, the recommended initial treatment is frequently invasive, comprising emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI, and angiography with revascularization (i.e., PCI and/or coronary artery bypass surgery) for NSTE-ACS.3,4 These evidence-based recommendations are supported by clinical trials demonstrating lower morbidity and mortality with emergent PCI compared to fibrinolytic therapy for patients with STEMI and with angiography/revascularization compared to medical therapy for patients with NSTE-ACS.5,6 Whereas these trials were not focused on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), sub-group analyses of patients with CKD demonstrated more favorable outcomes with invasive care than medical therapy.7 In addition, a meta-analysis of 7 observational studies with >23,000 patients with CKD found that early revascularization for ACS was associated with a >50% reduction in 1-year mortality compared to medical therapy.8 Bolstered by these findings, American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) clinical practice guidelines recommend emergent PCI to treat STEMI independent of patients’ level of kidney function, and angiography with revascularization to treat NSTE-ACS in high-risk patients with moderate CKD.3,4. 
Despite the AHA/ACC guidelines supporting invasive treatment (i.e., PCI for STEMI and angiography/revascularization for NSTE-ACS) in patients with CKD, multiple studies have demonstrated that patients with CKD are less likely to receive such care for ACS than those without CKD, a practice referred to as renalism.9-23 For example, one study of >57,000 patients with acute MI documented that patients with CKD were >50% less likely to undergo angiography than patients without CKD.23 However, none of the studies that identified renalism sought to identify the reasons for lower implementation of evidence-based invasive care in patients with CKD. Elucidating the underlying reasons for this seemingly inequitable use of evidence-based invasive care is essential to the development and implementation of a novel intervention(s) to improve the use of this treatment strategy in patients with CKD. To address this knowledge gap and design an intervention to address this issue, we propose a study with the following specific aims: 

Specific Aim 1: To assess the factors associated with differential implementation of evidence-based invasive care in patients with ACS and CKD using quantitative and qualitative research methods.
Hypothesis: There are identifiable and actionable patient-, provider-, and system-level factors that affect the implementation of evidence-based invasive care in patients with ACS and CKD.

Specific Aim 2: To utilize the data derived from analyses related to aim 1 to develop a novel intervention(s) to improve the use of evidence-based invasive care in patients with ACS and CKD. 
Hypothesis: Data derived from analyses of aim 1 will effectively inform the development of a novel intervention(s) to improve the implementation of evidence-based invasive care in patients with ACS and CKD.

1. Draft a specific aims page (2 pages maximum) of your proposed study. Consistent with most well-written D&I-focused specific aims pages, it should generally address the following 5 elements (and questions). 

Background: Health Problem, Evidence-Based Intervention, and Implementation Gap
Heart failure (HF) is a costly and complex health condition affecting millions of Americans.1,2 HF care is often fragmented which impacts quality of care, safety, and other outcomes.3-8 Structured Interprofessional Bedside Rounds (SIBR) were developed to bring together different health professions using a structured format to collaboratively arrive at a daily plan of care at the patient’s bedside.9-11 A growing body of research associates SIBR with improvements in care team communication and relationships that help reduce fragmentation of care. Despite these positive findings, an evidence gap exists as to whether implementation of SIBR is acceptable and appropriate to patients and providers.11-16 Preliminary data suggests that the majority of providers find value in SIBR,16 however this is not universal and there are concerns about changes in professional roles and practices (i.e. de-implementation of historic rounding models).16,17 Further exploration into these concerns and unintended consequences of SIBR are needed as they influence effectiveness and sustainability of SIBR. 

The SIBR model may also provide a supportive or enabling context for clinical pathway (CPW) implementation. CPW’s are collections of evidence-based therapies that have been shown to reduce complications, manage symptoms, and slow disease progression.3,18-21 CPW uptake and sustainment are underutilized in HF; a recent study found only 30% of patients in HF registries to be on CPWs.22 Systematic reviews have found the context of care to be highly influential in the success of CPW implementation.19-21 

To address these knowledge gaps, the proposed study leverages a timely opportunity to study patient and provider perspectives on SIBR (acceptability, appropriateness) and also to carry out the first known study of CPW implementation in a SIBR context (adoption/penetration) as models of care organization and delivery at the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC). The proposed research activities respond to NIH’s recent investments in implementation science to improve health by identifying the best strategies for ensuring successful integration of evidence-based interventions within clinical settings. 

Overall Goals and Specific Aims:
Two primary goals drive the study: 1) to explore patient and provider perspectives on structured interprofessional bedside rounding (SIBR) and 2) to determine whether SIBR provides a supportive or enabling context for successful CPW implementation in a critical care setting.

The specific aims that support these goals and their underlying hypotheses are detailed below. Each aim is framed in terms of an implementation science outcome as defined by Proctor, et al.23 Results of each aim will be submitted for presentation at conferences and for publication in peer reviewed journals. Funding support for these research activities will come from a K12 Career Development Award as part of the University of Washington’s new Implementation Science Training Program (UW-ISTP). 

Specific Aim 1:  Assess acceptability of SIBR and CPW implementation from the patient perspective using validated survey tools. Hypothesis 1a: Patients will perceive care provided in a SIBR context to be more acceptable (more satisfactory, more patient-centered) compared to a non-SIBR context. Hypothesis 1b: Patients will perceive use of CPW’s to guide their care as more acceptable compared to non-CPW.

Research Strategy: Using a cross-sectional descriptive study design, HF inpatients will be surveyed on acceptability of SIBR rounds as well as CPWs. Survey participants will be recruited from two UWMC cardiology units (combined total of approximately 45 beds) where multiple HF services see patients (two services use a SIBR approach; three  others do not). Using a stratified random sample approach we will recruit approximately equal numbers of patients who receive SIBR and non-SIBR rounds as well as on or not on a CPW (~80-100 based on power analysis to detect a moderate effect size for the primary SIBR outcome). The PI will consult with the nurse manager of each unit to assess eligibility of patients prior to approaching them to invite survey participation. Surveys will be distributed/collected at least once a week until recruitment goals have been met (anticipate 3-5 months). Two validated surveys will be utilized—the 16-item Patient’s Insights and Views of Teamwork (PIVOT) survey and the 14-item Patient Perceptions of Patient-Centeredness (PPPC) survey.10,43,44 In addition, demographic questions and a question to assess whether patients perceive value for themselves or others in the SIBR approach (of those who received SIBR) will be asked. Patient reports as to whether they received SIBR rounds and/or were on a CPW will also be collected and cross-referenced with care team records to allow for analysis of potential differences between patient groups (e.g. propensity score matching) as well as sub-analysis as to whether patients are aware that they are receiving these types of care approaches. Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to analyze survey results using STATA (or similar software). 
  
Specific Aim 2:  Explore acceptability and appropriateness of SIBR, CPWs & SIBR + CPW integration from the perspective of providers (attending physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) for whom SIBR and CPW implementation represent a need to de-implement previous rounding and care practices.18

Research Strategy:  A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews (in-person or telephone) will be carried out with providers working with HF populations in inpatient critical care settings where SIBR has been implemented in recent years (with and without CPW implementation). Recruitment will include a combination of purposive and snowball sampling at UWMC, the University of Virginia Health System (Charlottesville, VA) (note: collaborators at these sites have agreed to assist in identification and invitation of potential participants). Recruitment of participants beyond the UW will help ensure a diversity of perspectives on SIBR and CPWs, increasing rigor and trustworthiness of findings. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed. Analysis will be carried out simultaneously and iteratively with interviews using a constant comparative approach (and Atlas.ti) until interviews and analysis no longer yield new insights about major themes (anticipate ~ 30 interviews to reach thematic saturation).  Note: Results of this aim are intended to be hypothesis generating.  

Specific Aim 3:  Determine rates of CPW adoption/penetration (uptake and ongoing utilization) at UWMC on two AHF services where SIBR is the standard of practice. Hypothesis 3a: Implementation of a HF CPW in a SIBR context will result in successful adoption as determined by interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of clinical care and administrative data. Hypothesis 3b: CPW adoption will be moderated by whether the ordering service is closed (AHF service is the only one that has patients on the unit) compared to an open unit (multiple cardiology services have patients on the unit).

Research Strategy: Data will come from two Amalga-based data sources UW’s Horizon Business Insight (HBI) system (real-time tracking for CPW went live in December 2017) and a HF data mart created as part of a previously funded HRSA grant.1,2,45 The HF data mart requires minimal ongoing maintenance to meet K12/LRP research activity needs and will allow for both retrospective and prospective data collection needed for an ITS analysis.46-48 Variables will include whether a patient should have had a CPW ordered (i.e. HF diagnosis, work-up for heart transplant or vascular assist device), patient’s location (unit/service), ordering of, and adherence to CPW. Prior to testing hypothesis 3b, structured observations of SIBR approach in both services will be carried out to confirm there are observable differences in SIBR approach and utilization. 

Importance to Field:  

This project is relevant to implementation science in health practice as it will leverage and build on the work of both the SIBR and CPW initiatives allowing for a rigorous, innovative, and highly efficient approach to closing evidence gaps to improve care coordination (reduce fragmentation) and outcomes for critically ill inpatients with a HF diagnosis. Local, national, and international research and practice stakeholders have expressed interest in study findings to help identify best practices and guide resource allocations. Study results will provide pilot data and a strong foundation for a K23 or NIH RO1 application to examine connections between effective implementation of SIBR/CPW interventions and improvements in health outcomes.

Health problem: There has been a large increase in testosterone use, approved specifically for androgen deficiency or low endogenous testosterone levels, in the US over the past decade (Baillargeon et al., 2013). New testosterone prescriptions within the VA also increased substantially during this period (Jasuja et al., 2015). During fiscal year 2008-14, among all classes of medications, testosterone was the 13th most commonly prescribed drug in the VA, ranking just below cardiovascular medications, opioids, antidepressants and antipsychotics. This increase in has been attributed primarily to direct-to-consumer advertising of testosterone products. It has become common for clinicians to prescribe testosterone for age-related decline in testosterone levels and conditions, such as fatigue and sexual dysfunction, conditions for which it is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. The long-term risks and benefits of testosterone therapy have not been clearly demonstrated, especially in middle-aged and older men with age-related decline in testosterone.

Evidence-based practice, program, or guideline: The effectiveness of multi-faceted intervention, which combines a number of techniques in a single intervention rather than a single intervention alone has shown to be effective in reducing inappropriate prescribing (Clyne et al., 2015). In keeping with this, we believe that it will likely be necessary to employ a multi-level approach, with separate interventions at all three of these levels, to drive this behavior change: 1) at the patient-level: an educational brochure, 2) at the clinician-level: tools to address patient demand, and 3) at the site-level: involvement of the clinical pharmacists as a check point. At the patient-level, the use of a direct-to-consumer educational interventional brochure targeted towards patients has been successfully shown to reduce overuse and inappropriate prescribing of benzodiazpenes (Tannenbaum et al., 2014) and proton pump inhibitors (Krol et al., 2004). At the clinician-level, avoidance and delayed prescribing have been advocated as strategies that meets patients' expectations and, at the same time, helps avoid unnecessary use of medications (Dowell et al., 2001; Arroll et al., 2002). At the site-level, we plan to capitalize on the positive influence of pharmacists on improving prescribing by either providing higher quality care directly, or influencing others to do so (Nkansah et al., 2010). However, to the best of our knowledge, design, deployment, and evaluation of such a multi-faceted intervention to bring about guideline-concordant testosterone use has not been employed both within and outside the VA. 

Dissemination or implementation gap: The Endocrine Society guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of androgen deficiency should be made by ascertainment of signs and symptoms, together with low morning testosterone levels on 2 or more occasions. In one study, we showed that only 3% of VA patients received this entire recommended workup prior to being prescribed testosterone (Jasuja et al., 2015).  In another study, we reported that the majority of testosterone prescriptions within the VA were written for unapproved off-label indications, for which the risks and benefits are unknown (Jasuja et al., 2017). Using a mixed methods approach, we have also found that there is substantial variation in prescribing of this therapy at the patient-, clinician-, and site-level, with patient demands playing a significant role in testosterone prescribing, clinicians not making prescribing decisions in accordance with guidelines, site-specific background factors (such as differences in the interpretation of vague and conflicting guidelines) adding to the challenge of appropriate prescribing.  The proposed work will provide important data to better understand and recognize best practices for testosterone prescribing and help identify the likely existence of a subset of current testosterone prescriptions that may be candidates for de-implementation (such as age-related testosterone prescriptions or prescriptions for which testosterone is not FDA approved).  Potential barriers to successful implementation of the proposed intervention below will be changing clinician behavior to be guideline concordant, and the challenge of bringing about a system-level change to optimize testosterone prescribing in the VA. 

Specific aims: Using a hybrid type I study framework, we propose the following aims:	

Aim 1: Assess the effectiveness (impact on 1-year guideline discordant testosterone prescriptions) of the intervention.
Hypothesis: The multi-level intervention will result in a decreased proportion of guideline discordant prescriptions in the intervention group.
Approach: The intervention will be deployed at the site level to minimize issues of contamination, which would be a threat to study validity.  At the clinician-level, all primary care clinicians at the intervention site will be invited to participate in the study. At the patient-level, all male patients of these clinicians who received at least three fills of testosterone in the past year will be identified from VA Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) at the intervention site and invited to participate in the study. As part of the effectiveness component, we will examine post-intervention patient discontinuation rates of testosterone, whether the intervention prompted patient discussion of discontinuation with clinicians through post-intervention clinician survey, increase in clinician and pharmacists knowledge of guideline-concordant testosterone prescribing with post-intervention clinician and pharmacist survey, and the change in the proportion of guideline-discordant testosterone prescriptions before and after the intervention was implemented in the intervention compared to the control site, using a difference in differences analysis. 

Aim 2: Evaluate the reach of the intervention i.e. % of patients, clinicians, and pharmacists that received the intervention. 
Approach: We will carefully track data to determine the proportion of eligible patients, clinicians, and pharmacists who received the intervention. 

Aim 3: Assess the potential for future adoption, maintenance, and fidelity of the intervention. 
Approach: We will conduct semi-structured phone interviews with 10 patients on any concerns the brochure caused them, whether they found the information to be useful and if they believed it influenced dialogue with their clinician or pharmacist. Interviews with clinicians who prescribe testosterone (n=10) will explore their experience of the intervention, disruptions to clinical workflow or other barriers to adoption and maintenance, suggestions for improvement, and perceptions of the value of the intervention. Pharmacist interviews (n=10) will discuss impressions of their roles, whether they encountered resistance, difficulties carrying out this process and other general opinions of the intervention. Since maintenance of effect in the long-term also depends on leader and staff engagement, we will conduct phone interviews with key leaders and administrative staff (n=10) to assess their impressions, role played by a champion or stakeholder in facilitating the intervention, suggestions for improvement to further adapt it for local needs that will inform the expansion of the intervention to more VA sites. All interviews will be done post-intervention, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative thematic coding. This implementation information of our multilevel intervention, once shown to be effective and ready for scale up and spread will be used to design a larger implementation trial of our intervention, with multiple sites randomized to the intervention vs. control groups. 

Importance to the field: Findings from this study will help to inform policy makers and clinical leadership both within and outside of VA regarding barriers, facilitators, and feasibility of a multi-level implementation approach for optimal prescribing of testosterone (and by extension, other medications).  
";s:5:"xhtml";s:8231:"Jasuja # 1a<br /><br />Health problem: There has been a large increase in testosterone use, approved specifically for androgen deficiency or low endogenous testosterone levels, in the US over the past decade (Baillargeon et al., 2013). New testosterone prescriptions within the VA also increased substantially during this period (Jasuja et al., 2015). During fiscal year 2008-14, among all classes of medications, testosterone was the 13th most commonly prescribed drug in the VA, ranking just below cardiovascular medications, opioids, antidepressants and antipsychotics. This increase in has been attributed primarily to direct-to-consumer advertising of testosterone products. It has become common for clinicians to prescribe testosterone for age-related decline in testosterone levels and conditions, such as fatigue and sexual dysfunction, conditions for which it is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. The long-term risks and benefits of testosterone therapy have not been clearly demonstrated, especially in middle-aged and older men with age-related decline in testosterone.<br /><br />Evidence-based practice, program, or guideline: The effectiveness of multi-faceted intervention, which combines a number of techniques in a single intervention rather than a single intervention alone has shown to be effective in reducing inappropriate prescribing (Clyne et al., 2015). In keeping with this, we believe that it will likely be necessary to employ a multi-level approach, with separate interventions at all three of these levels, to drive this behavior change: 1) at the patient-level: an educational brochure, 2) at the clinician-level: tools to address patient demand, and 3) at the site-level: involvement of the clinical pharmacists as a check point. At the patient-level, the use of a direct-to-consumer educational interventional brochure targeted towards patients has been successfully shown to reduce overuse and inappropriate prescribing of benzodiazpenes (Tannenbaum et al., 2014) and proton pump inhibitors (Krol et al., 2004). At the clinician-level, avoidance and delayed prescribing have been advocated as strategies that meets patients&#039; expectations and, at the same time, helps avoid unnecessary use of medications (Dowell et al., 2001; Arroll et al., 2002). At the site-level, we plan to capitalize on the positive influence of pharmacists on improving prescribing by either providing higher quality care directly, or influencing others to do so (Nkansah et al., 2010). However, to the best of our knowledge, design, deployment, and evaluation of such a multi-faceted intervention to bring about guideline-concordant testosterone use has not been employed both within and outside the VA. <br /><br />Dissemination or implementation gap: The Endocrine Society guidelines recommend that the diagnosis of androgen deficiency should be made by ascertainment of signs and symptoms, together with low morning testosterone levels on 2 or more occasions. In one study, we showed that only 3% of VA patients received this entire recommended workup prior to being prescribed testosterone (Jasuja et al., 2015).  In another study, we reported that the majority of testosterone prescriptions within the VA were written for unapproved off-label indications, for which the risks and benefits are unknown (Jasuja et al., 2017). Using a mixed methods approach, we have also found that there is substantial variation in prescribing of this therapy at the patient-, clinician-, and site-level, with patient demands playing a significant role in testosterone prescribing, clinicians not making prescribing decisions in accordance with guidelines, site-specific background factors (such as differences in the interpretation of vague and conflicting guidelines) adding to the challenge of appropriate prescribing.  The proposed work will provide important data to better understand and recognize best practices for testosterone prescribing and help identify the likely existence of a subset of current testosterone prescriptions that may be candidates for de-implementation (such as age-related testosterone prescriptions or prescriptions for which testosterone is not FDA approved).  Potential barriers to successful implementation of the proposed intervention below will be changing clinician behavior to be guideline concordant, and the challenge of bringing about a system-level change to optimize testosterone prescribing in the VA. <br /><br />Specific aims: Using a hybrid type I study framework, we propose the following aims:	<br /><br />Aim 1: Assess the effectiveness (impact on 1-year guideline discordant testosterone prescriptions) of the intervention.<br />Hypothesis: The multi-level intervention will result in a decreased proportion of guideline discordant prescriptions in the intervention group.<br />Approach: The intervention will be deployed at the site level to minimize issues of contamination, which would be a threat to study validity.  At the clinician-level, all primary care clinicians at the intervention site will be invited to participate in the study. At the patient-level, all male patients of these clinicians who received at least three fills of testosterone in the past year will be identified from VA Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) at the intervention site and invited to participate in the study. As part of the effectiveness component, we will examine post-intervention patient discontinuation rates of testosterone, whether the intervention prompted patient discussion of discontinuation with clinicians through post-intervention clinician survey, increase in clinician and pharmacists knowledge of guideline-concordant testosterone prescribing with post-intervention clinician and pharmacist survey, and the change in the proportion of guideline-discordant testosterone prescriptions before and after the intervention was implemented in the intervention compared to the control site, using a difference in differences analysis. <br /><br />Aim 2: Evaluate the reach of the intervention i.e. % of patients, clinicians, and pharmacists that received the intervention. <br />Approach: We will carefully track data to determine the proportion of eligible patients, clinicians, and pharmacists who received the intervention. <br /><br />Aim 3: Assess the potential for future adoption, maintenance, and fidelity of the intervention. <br />Approach: We will conduct semi-structured phone interviews with 10 patients on any concerns the brochure caused them, whether they found the information to be useful and if they believed it influenced dialogue with their clinician or pharmacist.

Draft a specific aims page (2 pages maximum) of your proposed study. Consistent with most well-written D&I-focused specific aims pages, it should generally address the following 5 elements (and questions): 


Unnecessary tests and treatments carry risk for patients. There is a critical need to improve patient outcomes by rapidly and effectively “de-implementing” or reducing ineffective and potentially harmful medical practices.36-42 Bronchiolitis, the most common cause of hospitalization among infants, is an ideal condition to study de-implementation.43 Per published evidence-based bronchiolitis guidelines, ordered tests (i.e. viral studies, chest x-rays) and prescribed treatments (i.e., bronchodilators, steroids) carry risks and don’t improve patient outcomes.27,43 In partnership with the Choosing Wisely campaign, a prominent US effort to avoid unnecessary medical practices, the Pediatric Hospital Medicine Society put forth a mandate to de-implement unnecessary tests and treatments in acute respiratory illnesses like bronchiolitis.29 Despite this, most admitted bronchiolitis patients continue to receive tests and treatments that are unnessesary and potentially harmful. 27,31,44-47

My prior work in croup demonstrated that more testing and treatment does not improve patient outcomes,17 and that a bundled de-implementation strategy can significantly reduce over-testing and over-treatment in patients with bronchiolitis. In one year, at our hospital we reduced use of chest x-rays by 40%, and bronchodilators by 41% without negative clinical consequences for patients. Moreover, there was sustained and continued improvement in year two and three, and a significant “spill over” effect in reducing antibiotic use, likely related to decreased chest x-ray use minimizing over-diagnosis of pneumonia.44,48-51 Widespread implementation of this bundle would have significant clinical impact. However, a gap remains in our understanding of whether the influencing factors targeted by our bundle are generalizable across settings, which are the core components of our bundle, and whether our bundle can be feasibly implemented in other settings. This knowledge gap limits our ability to spread the intervention to other settings and diseases. To address this gap, the proposed project will employ an innovative, multiple level, theory-driven approach to 1) identify factors influencing overutilization in bronchiolitis, 2) iteratively develop a targeted set of strategies to de-implement tests and treatments (called Reduce Over-Utilized Tests and Treatments in Bronchiolitis or ROUTT-B), and 3) utilize a novel learning health system (LHS) called PEDSnet to conduct a feasibility study of these de-implementation strategies for reducing unnecessary tests and treatments in bronchiolitis patients. The overarching goal of this work is to advance the field of de-implementation science by identifying de-implementation processes and strategies that could be broadly adapted to varied contexts and diseases.

AIM 1: Identify factors influencing the overuse of chest x-rays (CXR), bronchodilators, and viral testing in bronchiolitis. At one high overuse and one low overuse PEDSnet institution, using PRISM (Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model)52 as a guide, I will use a combination of qualitative measurement techniques such as semi-structured interviews and mini ethnography to define 1) organizational, 2) patient-, and 3) provider-level influencing factors either driving or passively facilitating the overuse of tests/ treatments at each site, as well as the acceptability and feasibility of potential de-implementation strategies.

AIM 2: Develop ROUTT- B – a set of pragmatic, feasible, and effective de-implementation strategies for over-utilized tests and treatments in bronchiolitis that includes guidance on how to choose strategies based on an assessment of local influencing factors. I will work with a small group of implementation scientists and quality improvement leaders to match potentially actionable provider-, patient-, and setting-level factors with evidence-based behavior change techniques and system level de-implementation strategies.

AIM 3: Conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and de-implementation effectiveness of ROUTT-B. Using PEDSnet, I will conduct a 1-year non-randomized controlled pilot trial at one high (intervention) and one low (comparison) overuse PEDSnet hospital to measure stakeholder perceptions of feasibility and acceptability of ROUTT–B and preliminary de-implementation effectiveness (rates of CXR, bronchodilators, and viral testing).

The resulting menu of targeted de-implementation strategies will help future teams plan for and successfully de-implement non-recommended tests and treatments in their setting by guiding the selection of appropriate evidence-based strategies tailored to local influencing factors. As one of the first explorations of factors influencing overuse or enabling de-implementation, this study will provide data to support an R01 funded, large-scale, pragmatic, randomized-controlled trial of ROUTT- B in PEDSnet so that ineffective and potentially harmful medical practices in bronchiolitis care are reduced.

1. Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?

My response to this is:
We will be measuring and monitoring fidelity as we implement a standardized approach for dosing and progressing the intensity of physical therapy interventions in the home health care setting. Physical therapists and physical therapy assistants (together referred to as “therapists”) will monitor patients’ physical exertion during treatment and use this information to dose and progress activities. Physical exertion will be measured using heart rate (HR), unless the patient is on a medication (e.g., beta blocker) that prohibits normal heart rate response, then exertion will be measured using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) 6-20 scale. A quick reference guide will be created for therapists showing evidence-based target intensities for different patient populations. Therapists will monitor patients’ HR with wrist worn monitors. RPE will be monitored by having patients self-report RPE during activities. RPE will be documented by therapists on an iPad. To decrease documentation burden, the iPad will have a customized survey program that allows therapists to enter RPE by touching buttons on the screen corresponding to the reported perceived exertion. The RPE ratings will automatically download into a REDCap database. Patients’ HR monitoring data will also be downloaded into a secure database. While therapists will only use HR and RPE to guide intensity of treatment activities in real-time, the study team will use the collected HR and RPE data for audit and feedback. Therapists will be instructed to dose all mobility activities in target intensity ranges, specific to the patients’ condition and comorbidities. Activities should be progressed if intensity is below the target range and made easier if intensity is above the range. We will monitor fidelity using a multifaceted approach with measurement of adherence to the content, frequency, and coverage of the intensity-based program. Content adherence will be defined as the proportion of mobility activities dosed at the target intensity during treatment sessions. Frequency adherence will be defined as the proportion of treatment sessions therapists achieve target intensities with patients out of all treatment sessions the therapist delivers in a week. Coverage will be defined as the proportion of patients who achieve target intensities out of all patients the therapist treats over the calendar month. The quantitative adherence data will be used for audit and feedback and to guide qualitative data collection (e.g., barrier assessments). Appropriate adaptations will be made and documented (further information is response to Question 2).

There is limited information that associates fidelity of this intervention in this context to individual-level outcomes. We will be assessing this in our hybrid study design.

2. Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?

My response to this is:
We will likely need to make adaptations to the standardized approach for dosing and progressing the intensity of physical therapy interventions in the home health setting. We plan to iteratively adapt both the intervention and implementation strategies throughout the pre-implementation (6 months) and facilitated implementation (1 year) phases. We may need to adapt the training plan, the technology (e.g., heart rate monitors, iPads), the audit and feedback protocol, and/or the intervention assessment plan (e.g., timing, quantitative assessment tools, qualitative interview guides). To guide adaptations, we will assess barriers and facilitators and develop modifications to improve fidelity and/or congruence with the existing workflow. All adaptations will be recorded in an Adaptations Log and coded according to the Wiltsey-Stirman framework. During the pre-implementation phase, we will conduct observations of and key informant interviews with treating therapists. Adaptations will be made prior to implementation to preemptively address potential barriers. We will also perform barrier assessments at 3-month intervals during the facilitated implementation phase and adapt the intervention and/or implementation strategies as needed. Over the 1-year sustainability phase, we will conduct observations of and interviews with treating therapists to determine how the intervention has been adapted after facilitated implementation ends.

1.	Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?

2.	Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?

My response to question 1:
Yes, I will be measuring fidelity. One of the sub-specific aims focusses on fidelity specifically. Specific Aim 1a. “To evaluate the fidelity to the intervention by providers who include physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.”

We will assess intervention fidelity using a five-item tool described by Dane and Schneider (Dane & Schneider 1998). We will adapt this tool to the study. The five components of this tool include: 
1)	Adherence: adoption of intervention components as planned in the protocol.
2)	Exposure or dose: amount of intervention content received by participants.
3)	Quality of the delivery: theory-based ideal in terms of processes and content or participants’ skill of executing the intervention.
4)	Participant responsiveness: engagement of the participants. 
5)	Program differentiation: unique features of the intervention are distinguishable from other programs.

Through focus group discussions, we will assess the exposure to the intervention, quality of delivery of the intervention, participant responsiveness to the intervention and intervention differentiation. For example, we will query participants regarding the extent to which intervention components reached them (exposure), if communications to discontinue or continue PPI were effective (quality of delivery), and perceived intervention engagement (participant responsiveness). We will assess the fifth and final fidelity measure, intervention adherence, by reviewing the electronic medical records to abstract data on the percentage of cases in which the stewardship recommendations were accepted or not accepted. We will use a chart abstraction tool to collect this information.
Although in this study, fidelity perse is an outcome, there is evidence in the education literature that supports the effectiveness of these fidelity components in improving individual outcomes (Dusenbury, Brannigan & Falco 2003).

My response to question 2:

Yes, we plan to build in the study regular feedback from a sample of implementing participants. Based upon their feedback we will adapt the intervention as it is being delivered. Therefore, feedback from the antibiotic stewardship team, providers and a panel of patients will be the process by which adaptations to the intervention will be guided.

Examples of adaptations to the intervention following feedback from stakeholders:
•	The antibiotic stewardship (AS) team may suggest that the PPI recommendation be sent at less frequent schedule e.g. every other day vs. everyday.
•	The AS team may suggest that the PPI recommendation be sent to only physicians vs. every prescribing clinician.
•	Stakeholders may suggest other components/approaches to help with PPI deprescribing that we could add to our prototype intervention.
•	Stakeholders may suggest more outcomes other beyond what we propose.

1. Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?

2. Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?

My Response to Question 1:
As described in my module 1 response, my project involves two evidence-based interventions (EBI).  The first EBI is structured interprofessional bedside rounds (SIBR) and the second EBI is a heart failure clinical pathway (CPW’s).  While I am not implementing either of these EBI’s I will be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which each is delivered.  For SIBR, I plan to assess fidelity in a number of ways—first, I will be gathering and reviewing tracking information that is collected by the service/unit with regards to: 1) start time of rounds, 2) whether nurses were contacted prior to the rounding team reaching their patients, and 3) whether nurses were present in the patient’s room during rounds.  Second (as part of Aim 3), I plan to observe rounds for 20 days (10 days on each of two units to better understand differences in implementation and fidelity of SIBR between the two)—during observations I will utilize a previously developed/adapted (by myself and another colleague) observation tool that includes both quantitative and qualitative elements.  Third, I will include questions in both the patient surveys (Aim 1) and provider interviews (Aim 2) about SIBR fidelity. 
 
There is currently minimal evidence that I am aware of that associate’s level of fidelity of SIBR or CPW’s with individual level outcomes and none that looks at SIBR+CPW’s and outcomes. However, I am in the early stages of a systematic review that includes exploration of these association’s, so I am hoping to be able to summarize the extent to which knowledge of these associations exist and to describe the extent to which this is a gap in the literature.
 
My Response to Question 2:
Adaptations are highly likely to need to be made to both of the EBI’s I am studying as they are scaled, spread, and sustained. While I am not proposing to implement either of these EBI’s—but to instead study their implementation—questions of adaptations are relevant to consider for the current study as well as future implementation work that I plan to undertake and are something that I plan to assess.  

For SIBR, adaptations are likely to include: timing of SIBR in the day, frequency of rounds using a SIBR approach (e.g. daily vs. weekly), professions/occupations present during rounds, types of clinical information discussed during SIBR.  For CPW’s adaptations are likely to include what is included in the CPW and what is tracked as part of the CPW (and where/how it is tracked/who tracks), when a CPW is started, when a CPW is ended, when the team discusses CPW tracking, and who follows up if a patient “goes off” the pathway.  

The process that I would likely use to guide adaptation of EBI implementation would likely include rapid cycle quality improvement and facilitation.

My response to question 1:

As outlined in my specific aims, the focus of my project is to lay the groundwork to develop an intervention that would be directed towards increasing the appropriate utilization of evidence-based invasive care for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome in patients with chronic kidney disease. Once the intervention is developed, I do intend to include monitoring and measurement of fidelity of the intervention when it rolled out. First, I intend to gather self-report data from the individuals delivering the intervention as well as the cardiology practitioners to whom the intervention is being delivered. Second, I intend to develop a systematic process of in-person observation of the delivery of the intervention to practitioners to identify variability in delivery and response of practitioners. I intend to quantify and qualify the fidelity of the intervention during this in-person observation. As part of the in-person observation, I will assess the consistency of the materials/information provided during the intervention with the actual components of the intervention as originally designed. 

I am not aware of any data in the context of an intervention to improve use of evidence based cardiac care in patients with kidney disease that associates the level of fidelity with individual patient outcomes. However, I intend to track outcomes (i.e., utilization of invasive coronary procedures, patient mortality) to measure the association of intervention fidelity with such outcomes. 

My response to question 2

I anticipate that there will be adaptations that will need to be made to the intervention. I believe that with regular updates to the evidence underlying the use of invasive care in patients with CKD, that components of the intervention will need to be modified to conform with updates in the standard of care. Ongoing monitoring of clinical practice guidelines that inform the delivery of such care will be performed and the content of the intervention will be modified accordingly. Additionally, I anticipate that components of the intervention will need to be adapted based on the specific nature of the patient population providers care for. For example, adaptations to providers with patients who have more severe levels of kidney disease are likely to be necessary. I intend to incorporate real time and follow up feedback from practitioners to whom the intervention has been delivered to inform the process of adaptation.

Response: Since this is a pilot study intended to establish feasibility and set the stage for a larger study to follow, it will be important to measure and monitor the fidelity of the multi-level intervention, which seeks to optimize testosterone prescribing. To assess fidelity, we will conduct post-intervention semi-structured phone interviews with patients, clinicians and pharmacists. Interviews with patients who are already on testosterone therapy will explore if the information in the educational brochure, which seeks to inform them about the implications of testosterone therapy was well-communicated and useful and did not cause any concern. Interviews with clinicians will discuss as to whether they used any of the intervention tools (avoidance and delay) to address patient demands in their encounter with patients. Pharmacist interviews will explore whether they were able to perform quality checks i.e. confirm by reviewing patient records if two low levels of endogenous testosterone (<300 ng/dL) in the morning (between 5 a.m.-10 a.m.) have been documented before dispensing the fill. Since fidelity in the long-term also depends on leader and staff engagement, we will conduct phone interviews with key leaders and administrative staff to assess supports in place to ensure consistent delivery of the intervention as intended. 

2.	Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?

Response: This project is a feasibility trial, which will be conducted at two VA sites. While the intervention will be introduced at one VA site the other site will serve as a comparison site, At the end of this feasibility trial, we will plan to collect data from patients, clinicians, leadership and staff through semi-structured interviews on their impressions of the intervention specifically, satisfaction, ease of use, barriers to adoption and suggestions for improvement for purposes of adaption for subsequent regional or national expansion of this intervention to more VA sites. At the patient-level, the content of the educational brochure will need to be tailored to the type of patients receiving testosterone at a specific site. If the patients at a site are primarily older and potentially receiving this therapy for age-related conditions, then the educational brochure would need to speak more about the normal aging-related testosterone changes and associated medical conditions, risks associated with inappropriate testosterone use, and how to seek advice from providers or pharmacists regarding potential concerns. If the patients receiving testosterone at a site are mostly younger males (< 50 years), then the content in the educational brochure would be tailored to the potential use of testosterone for performance or beauty enhancement purposes and associated risks with this inappropriate use. At the clinician-level, though this intervention will be targeted towards primary care providers however, there would be a potential need for contextual adaptation to expand the intervention to involve endocrinologists or urologists at a site if they are engaging in inappropriate testosterone prescribing. At the site-level, contextual changes would potentially need to be made to the intervention depending on the leadership and culture that contributes to the pattern of testosterone prescribing. For example, we might need to enroll additional personnel for data collection through interviews if the leadership and clinicians at a site identify a particular VA employee as exerting an important influence on testosterone prescribing or pharmacy-related practice (informal opinion leader) at a specific site. 
	These adaptations will be purposeful, planned and informed by previous studies conducted in the VA to understand testosterone prescribing, summary data and knowledge input from leadership and key opinion leaders at sites. Based on data from our feasibility trial, we will consider modification of the intervention during the planning stages before we roll out and expand the intervention in multiple VA sites.

1. Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?

My project is interesting in that I would define my "intervention" as the bronchiolitis evidence-informed clinical practice guidelines (CPG). My project aim is to determine effective "implementation strategies" for the CPG. I hypothesize that there will be a core set of implementation strategies that will be generalizable across contexts, and other implementation strategies that will be context specific. So in measuring fidelity I will be measuring both fidelity to the CPG and to the (core?) IS's. 
-To measure fidelity to the CPG: 
Proportion of eligible patients not receiving each of the targeted tests/treatments 
Characteristics and representativeness of patients who do not receive targeted tests/treatments (based on select demographics)
Proportion of providers who order targeted tests/treatments at rates at or below the achievable benchmark of care

-Fidelity to IS: 
Process measures for each IS (for example, audit and feedback distributed to x of y providers at x time interval)

There is evidence that reducing unnecessary tests and treatment to provide guideline concordant care results in lower healthcare costs and a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use without unintended consequences for patients. However, the goal is not to eliminate these tests/treatments completely and it is unclear which patients under what circumstances would benefit from them. There is no evidence that fidelity to the IS's changes individual outcomes.


2. Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?

Again, this is difficult. For the "intervention" or CPG, it is possible that over time data about which patients continue to receive the targeted tests/treatments and for what reasons would be useful in refining and updating the CPG. However, this is not "adaptation" as it is defined in the readings. 

I think many of the IS's will need to be adapted to local context. I plan to develop a tool for local teams to use to choose IS's tailored to their local context from a menu of IS's that includes step by step instructions for using each IS as well as the expected implementation cost. I think this is a form of guided adaption.  For each of the individual IS's, I would imagine they may need to be adapted based on local context, capacity, resources, etc.  I'm not sure what process I would use to guide the adaption of each individual chosen IS in each individual context.

1.	Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?
2.	How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)?

My response to question 1 and 2:

A human factors systems engineering model called the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) 2.0 Framework is what I propose to use to my study. Along with this model, we will use a conceptual framework that is adapted from a successful antimicrobial stewardship (AS) conceptual framework (N. Fishman 2006). 
The SEIPS model is applicable to my study because it provides a road map to describe the elements of the system or context that can affect processes and outcomes: (1) people, (2) tasks, (3) tools and technologies, (4) organization, and (5) environment. These five elements constitute context, which in this case will be defined as “characteristics of the organization and its environment that influence implementation of an intervention.” The SEIPS model describes context, particularly how various aspects of systems interact to influence each other. In order to improve care processes and outcomes, attention is dedicated to identifying elements of the work system that either hinder or facilitate the work of healthcare professionals in delivering high quality care such as guideline concordant PPI use.
The conceptual framework based on N. Fishman’s AS conceptual framework, will explicate factors that contribute to the dependent variable— non-guideline concordant PPI use by providers (physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants). Our proposed PPI de-implementation intervention aims at influencing factors that lead to non-guideline concordant PPI use and promote PPI stewardship.

1.	What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
My response to this is:

Implementation outcomes

Proportion of patients with reduced or discontinued dose
How: Data extraction from the electronic medical record (EMR)
Why: To determine adoption or uptake of the PPI de-implementation intervention

Fidelity
How: Five components of fidelity (see below) will be assessed individually using different methods.
Why: To assess the extent to which our intervention was implemented according to how it was planned

     Exposure 
       How: Self-report through focus groups
       Why: To measure the extent to which participants found the education and mentored implementation 
       approach useful

     Quality of the delivery
       How: Self-report through focus groups
       Why: To assess whether participants felt that audit and feedback to discontinue or modify PPI was 
       effective

     Participant responsiveness
       How: Self-report through focus groups
       Why: To assess whether participants felt engaged in the intervention

     Program differentiation
       How: Self-report through focus groups
       Why: To assess things that participants found to this intervention

     Intervention Adherence
       How: Through process measures to determine the percentage of cases in which a PPI de-implementation 
       recommendation were accepted or not accepted
       Why: To determine penetration of the PPI de-implementation intervention

Drug costs (both PPIs and antibiotics used to treat CDI) averted by the intervention
How: Through a budget-impact analysis comparing the cost of medication during the control and intervention 
periods
Why: To determine whether the intervention affected drugs costs

Barriers to the de-implementation of nonconcordant PPI use
How: Individual interviews and focus group discussions of all involved stakeholders
Why: To identify specific factors that need to be addressed in order to de-implement non-guideline concordant PPI use

Clinical outcomes

C.difficile infections (CDI)
How: EMR extraction
Why: To determine whether the intervention affected CDI

2.	What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
My response to this is:

(i). The percentage of cases in which AS team recommendations were accepted or not accepted. We will measure this through EMR extraction of the numerator and denominator data. We will divide the number of accepted recommendations out of all the total number of sent recommendations. This will help determine the penetration of the PPI de-implementation intervention

(ii). Drug costs (both PPIs and antibiotics used to treat CDI) averted by the intervention.
This will accomplished through a budget impact analysis that will compare the cost of medication during the control and intervention periods. This will help determine whether the intervention affected drugs costs

3.	Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not?

My response to this is:
Yes, we plan to assess the proportion of patients for whom PPIs were stopped or de-escalated when they had a clear indication for them. This will be accomplished by conducting a chart review and flag out any patients for whom the PPI dosing changed during the study period. We will identify those patients for whom the dosing was reduced or PPI stopped and assess using a PPI indications list to determine if the patient’s PPI de-escalation was necessary or not.

Response: The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) model is most applicable for our feasibility/pilot study as this evaluation framework will work well in evaluating both the effectiveness of the proposed multi-level intervention to improve testosterone prescribing in the VA as well as the implementation assessment of future scale up of the intervention on a regional or national level. 
    
2.	How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)?
Response: Our RE-AIM evaluation model and its domains have helped us guide both our aims and outcomes, which we plan to measure. Specifically, aim 1 of our proposed study plans to assess the effectiveness of the proposed multi-level intervention, which is the primary outcome of our study. In aims 2 and 3, we plan to evaluate implementation outcomes, including reach, adoption, maintenance and fidelity of the intervention as informed by the RE-AIM model. 

Assignment 3b

1.	What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
Response: In terms of clinical outcomes, I plan to assess the effectiveness of the intervention by measuring the impact of the intervention on 1-year guideline discordant testosterone prescriptions. This is the primary outcome for our proposed study. As part of the effectiveness component, we will examine post-intervention patient discontinuation rates of testosterone from the VA data, whether the intervention prompted patient discussion of discontinuation with clinicians through post-intervention clinician survey, increase in clinician and pharmacists knowledge of guideline-concordant testosterone prescribing with post-intervention clinician and pharmacist survey, and the change in the proportion of guideline-discordant testosterone prescriptions before and after the intervention was implemented in the intervention compared to the control site using the VA data, using a difference in differences analysis. The reason for measuring effectiveness of the intervention is because we want to examine whether this multi-level intervention to optimize testosterone prescribing in the VA is effective or not. 
In terms of implementation outcomes, I plan to assess reach, adoption, maintenance and fidelity of the multi-level intervention. We will measure reach by carefully track data from VA to determine the proportion of eligible patients, clinicians, and pharmacists who received the intervention. For adoption and maintenance, we will conduct semi-structured phone interviews with 10 patients on any concerns the brochure caused them, whether they found the information to be useful and if they believed it influenced dialogue with their provider or pharmacist. Interviews with clinicians who prescribe testosterone will explore their experience of the intervention, disruptions to clinical workflow or other barriers to adoption and maintenance, suggestions for improvement, and perceptions of the value of the intervention. Pharmacist interviews will discuss impressions of their roles, whether they encountered resistance, difficulties carrying out this process and other general opinions of the intervention. Since maintenance of effect in the long-term also depends on leader and staff engagement, we will conduct phone interviews with key leaders and administrative staff to assess their impressions, role played by a champion or stakeholder in facilitating the intervention, suggestions for improvement to further adapt it for local needs that will inform the expansion of the intervention to more VA sites. We are measuring these implementation outcomes since this is a feasibility/pilot stud and if this implementation information of our multilevel intervention, once shown to be effective and ready for scale up and spread will be used to design a larger implementation trial of our intervention, with multiple sites randomized to the intervention vs. control groups. 

2.	What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
Response: One of the processes we hope to influence with our intervention at the clinician level will be the change in decision-making process to prescribe testosterone appropriately. Specifically, to address unnecessary inappropriate patient demands, we will educate the clinician about what evidence-based guidelines recommend for testosterone prescribing and alternative ways to respond to these demands, using avoidance and delay strategies used effectively in the antibiotic prescribing area. We will measure the increase in clinician knowledge on evidence-based prescribing with post-intervention interviews. The clinician’s decision when to prescribe testosterone is an important piece that needs to impacted if testosterone prescribing needs to be improved. 
We will also attempt to effect the pharmacy dispensing process with our intervention so as to engage the pharmacists as check-points during the medication dispensing process. Specifically, as part of our intervention pharmacists will be educated to ensure that testosterone is being dispensed after diagnostic and baseline evaluations have been documented as per guidelines. This increase in pharmacist knowledge on evidence-based testosterone prescribing will be assessed through post-intervention pharmacist surveys. The effectiveness of the pharmacists in facilitating guideline-concordant prescribing can be tapped for improving prescribing for other medications as well. 

3.	Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not?
Response: Since we hope to incorporate the strategies of avoidance and delay in the clinician prescribing behavior in testosterone prescribing, a potential co-benefit of this might be that clinicians might adopt these strategies in prescribing of other similar medications such as antibiotics as well. Similar spill over effects might be observed with the pharmacists in their role as check points for ensuring that appropriate diagnostic evaluations are in place before dispensing testosterone to dispensing of other medications as well.  We will measure these two spill-over effects at the clinician and the pharmacist level by incorporating questions in the post-intervention questionnaire that besides the testosterone prescribing/dispensing process if the intervention strategies influenced their prescribing/dispensing practices for other medications.

1.	Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?

My response to this is:
The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is most applicable to our proposed study. Our overarching hypothesis is that the systematic development of multifaceted implementation strategies will facilitate adoption of and fidelity to the standardized approach and will result in a sustainable aspect of care that improves patients’ home health physical therapy outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will need to identify the determinants (barriers and facilitators) impacting implementation and sustainability. The CFIR is a comprehensive determinant framework.

2.	How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)? 

My response to this is:
We will use the CFIR domains and constructs to develop key informant interview guides for the pre-implementation (planning), the facilitated implementation, and the sustainability phases. We will use the CFIR as a coding framework for all qualitative analyses. During the pre-implementation and facilitated implementation phases, findings from qualitative analyses will be used for formative evaluation. We will map the barriers identified within each domain/construct to implementation strategies using the CFIR-ERIC Matching Tool v1.0. We will track and report the following components of implementation strategies: actor, action, action target, temporality, dose, implementation outcome affected, and justification. 


MIDDLETON – Assignment #3b – Measures & Evaluations
1.	What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

My response to this is:
In this hybrid study, we will be assessing both effectiveness and implementation outcomes. Effectiveness outcomes will be patient-level and include change in functional independence over the episode of home health care and patient satisfaction with their home health physical therapy care. Functional independence will be measured with the functional items on the OASIS instrument. The OASIS is a comprehensive assessment performed on all home health care patients at specific time points over their course of care. We will use functional data from the initial evaluation (start of care) and the discharge evaluation (end of care). Because the OASIS is already collected as part of usual care, using this data to assess functional outcomes will not increase physical therapists’ burden. Patient satisfaction will be assessed with a 100 point visual analog scale at each treatment session (treatment satisfaction) and at discharge (satisfaction with overall physical therapy care).

We will also assess the following implementation outcomes, appropriateness, fidelity, and sustainability. Appropriateness is an outcome of interest because our goal is to successfully integrate a standardized approach to dosing and progressing physical therapy interventions into the home health setting. In order for the approach to be integrated into care, it will need to compatible, useful, and practical in this setting. Tracking treating therapists and administrators’ perceptions of the standardized approach will provide insight into how appropriateness changes over time as therapist characteristics change (e.g., knowledge and beliefs, self-efficacy), the intervention is adapted, and new implementation strategies are employed. To assess and monitor appropriateness over the pre-implementation, facilitated implementation, and sustainability phases, we will develop key informant interview questions related to the “Intervention Characteristics” and “Inner Setting” domains of the CFIR. We hypothesize that appropriateness will increase over time. 

Fidelity to the standardized approach will also be an outcome of interest. Fidelity will need to be assessed and monitored in order to achieve Aim 1: “Identify the multifaceted implementation strategies that maximize therapists’ adherence to a standardized approach for dosing and progressing the intensity of activities during home health sessions.” As well as Aim 3: “Determine the factors that impact sustainability of a standardized approach for dosing and progressing the intensity of physical therapy interventions in the home health setting.” We will be using patient heart rate and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) data to monitor fidelity. Fidelity will be monitored on an ongoing basis for all intervention group physical therapists. Data from every treatment session delivered will be aggregated by therapist for analyses. Sustainability will be assessed and monitored over the 1.5 years after the facilitated implementation phase ends (sustainability phase) using fidelity information and qualitative data. We will use the CFIR to develop key informant interview guides to identify barriers and facilitators to sustainment among intervention therapists and administrators.

2.	What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

My response to this is:
We will be using patient heart rate and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) (for patients on medications that impact heart rate response) data to determine whether or not therapists are delivering interventions at the target intensities. In order to get this information, therapists will have to put heart rate monitors on patients or record RPE ratings. We will be monitoring this process. Monitoring will be straightforward- if no heart rate or RPE data is available for a treatment session, the therapist did not perform the process.

3.	Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not? 

My response to this is:
We will not be measuring for co-benefits. However, we expect that patients will experience physiologic (e.g., muscular adaptations) and clinical (e.g., cardiovascular adaptations) improvements in addition to functional improvements. Regarding unintended consequences, we will be monitoring adverse events over the study period. We will also include questions related to unexpected outcomes/patient responses in our ongoing key informant interviews with physical therapists over the facilitated implementation and sustainability phases.

AIM 1: PRISM (Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model) will guide the measurement of barriers/facilitators that affect healthcare providers’ (recipients in PRISM) decisions to order or not order tests/treatments. PRISM has two main parts, the RE-AIM outcomes (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) and the context that influences RE-AIM including: the external environment, the implementation and sustainability infrastructure, and the organizational and patient perspectives and characteristics.  Using PRISM as a guide, I will use a combination of qualitative techniques to define barriers/facilitators at each of the study institutions from the perspective of multiple levels of stakeholders (organization, patient and provider). Differences in barriers/facilitators between low and high overuse hospitals and low and high utilizing providers will be assessed along with acceptance of past (pilot site) and potential future de-implementation strategies. Measuring context using multiple approaches, from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders (including parents), and across two sites that differ in baseline overuse of tests/treatments and prior exposure to de-implementation strategies will afford a comprehensive list of potentially modifiable barriers/facilitators which will facilitate the future adaption of ROUTT-B to multiple contexts. 
AIM 2: PRISM will inform the selection of de-implementation strategies included in ROUTT-B. Barriers and facilitators from each PRISM construct will be mapped to appropriate de-implementation strategies. [Here I am wondering about using CFIR/ERIC instead as PRISM constructs have not been mapped to IS’s. I am open to input.] 
AIM 3: To design a future randomized controlled trial to measure ROUTT-B’s effect on patient outcomes, I must first demonstrate the feasibility, acceptability and de-implementation effectiveness of ROUTT-B in a pilot study. To do this I will measure the RE-AIM components of PRISM. The RE-AIM components of the PRISM have been broadly applied for D&I research, and the application of RE-AIM in this initial pilot evaluation of ROUTT-B should increase its future reach, effectiveness, adoption, feasibility, and sustainability. I will use RE-AIM to measure the “I”mplementation dimension of RE-A”I”M including: 1) feasibility of deploying ROUTT-B from the perspectives of the quality improvement team at NCH who will deploy it, 2) acceptability and appropriateness of the de-implementation strategies from the parent, provider, and care team perspective, and 3) de-implementation effectiveness (change in the utilization rates of CXR, bronchodilators, and VT). I will secondarily measure the effect of ROUTT-B on the other components of RE-AIM. While I measured de-implementation effectiveness (change in utilization) in my published CHCO pilot, to understand the full impact of ROUTT-B (which may or may not include some of the same strategies used in the CHCO pilot) we must evaluate the other dimensions of RE-AIM including reach, effectiveness, adoption, (feasibility, acceptability), and maintenance prior to dissemination. For example, measuring reach, or the characteristics and representativeness of the patients that don’t receive testing/treatment may provide important insight into how overuse and/or de-implementation contributes to health care disparities.

I will secondarily measure the effect of ROUTT-B on the other components of RE-AIM. While I measured de-implementation effectiveness (change in utilization) in my published CHCO pilot, to understand the full impact of ROUTT-B (which may or may not include some of the same strategies used in the CHCO pilot) we must evaluate the other dimensions of RE-AIM including reach, effectiveness, adoption, (feasibility, acceptability), and maintenance prior to dissemination. For example, measuring reach, or the characteristics and representativeness of the patients that don’t receive testing/treatment may provide important insight into how overuse and/or de-implementation contributes to health care disparities.<br /><br />Tyler – Assignment #3b - Measures &amp; Evaluations<br />1.

Assignment #3a: Models

1. Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?

My response to this is:  The models that are most applicable to my study are the conceptual framework for implementation outcomes (Proctor et al, 2009) and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).  These two frameworks are most applicable because they align with the answering the questions that I have identified in my study: 1) to explore patient and provider perspectives on structured interprofessional bedside rounding (SIBR) and 2) to determine whether SIBR provides a supportive or enabling context for successful CPW implementation in a critical care setting.  
  
2. How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)? 

My response to this is: I have utilized outcomes as defined by Proctor et al. to focus my specific aims on acceptability, appropriateness of SIBR from patient and provider perspectives and adoption/penetration of clinical pathways in a SIBR context. I plan to use the CFIR to guide development of the provider interview guide and analysis of provider interviews as well as to guide the selection of patient interview tools and to potentially add questions to the observation tool that I will utilize during clinical observations.  I have been reviewing a number of the specific data collection tools and guides on the CFIR website that will be valuable resources in this regard.   

Assignment #3b:  Measures & Evaluations 

1. What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

My response to this is:

The outcomes that I am measuring in my study are outlined below (along with how/why):
Implementation Outcomes:
1.	Acceptability (from patient perspective): I plan to measure acceptability of SIBR (primarily) and clinical pathways (secondarily) from the patient perspective using surveys (as per the recommendations on the first assignment I am also considering whether I might be able to include patient interviews to obtain richer information—will depend on resources as well as institutional acceptability). I have identified two surveys (one of patient’s views of teamwork and one of patient’s perceptions of patient centeredness of care) and am currently conducting a systematic review of SIBR implementations and will summarize what types of surveys have been utilized that might be relevant. I would like to also include family member/caregiver perspectives in this process but am still determining whether I can include them in the scope of the currently funded project.  While I have been hearing that implementation science typically focuses on care team members there is currently a gap in the literature about patient perspectives on rounds that I think is important to address and is relevant to future strategies for SIBR implementations.
2.	Acceptability & Appropriateness (from provider perspective):  I plan to conduct semi-structured interviews with providers where SIBR has been implemented in recent years to assess both acceptability and appropriateness of SIBR implementation from the provider perspective.  There has been little to no previous work on exploring SIBR from this perspective and this will fill a key information gap for future implementation efforts.  
3.	Adoption (of clinical pathway (CPW) in a SIBR context): I will utilize both structured observations as well as administrative data to assess clinical pathway adoption in two units using SIBR.  I plan to initially observe the current state of SIBR practice (fidelity) and CPW utilization (whether they are referenced during rounds) in both units (8-10 days each) to better understand current practices as well as whether there are observable differences between the two units.  I will also utilize administrative data to track whether CPW’s are being ordered for heart failure patients and the extent to which CPW’s are being carried out.   
4.	Penetration (of CPW in a SIBR context): I will assess ongoing CPW utilization (penetration) using administrative data and an interrupted time series design.  

2. What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

My response to this is:  I will be gathering patient and provider perspectives on SIBR implementation using qualitative data.  I will be using observational data to gather information about use of SIBR and CPW’s.  I will also be using administrative data to measure CPW uptake.  This mixed method data collection will help to add data to the body of literature around SIBR implementation that is richer than is currently available. 
 
3. Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not? 

My response to this is:  One of the reasons that I am planning to carry out surveys and interviews with patients and providers as well as to do unit level observations is to be better able to assess co-benefits and unintended consequences of SIBR implementation.

Assignment #3a: Models

1. Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?
Our study draws from both the conceptual framework for health care disparities and the CFIR model to guide our inquiry into factors underlying inequities in the use of invasive treatment for acute coronary syndrome between Veterans with and without CKD. The CFIR model is applicable to the current study because it combines theories from across implementation science and covers five key domains: intervention characteristics (in this case, use of invasive care for CKD), inner setting (hospital), outer setting (environment-at-large), characteristics of individuals (patients, cardiologists, nephrologists), as well as the implementation process. Additionally, CFIR domains incorporate patient-, provider-, and system-level factors in a systematic and comprehensive way.

2. How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)? 

The CFIR model will also guide the foci of patient and provider interviews to explore factors that affect the implementation of evidence-based invasive care for Veterans with chronic kidney disease and acute coronary syndrome. Specifically, the following domains and constructs will guide these semi-structured interviews: 
INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS 
Evidence strength and quality: Cardiologists and nephrologists are involved in decisions about the use of invasive care for ACS. Evidence supporting the use of invasive care for patients with CKD may not be known to these providers. We will ask providers about which evidence, if any, they draw upon when considering the use of invasive care in patients with CKD. We will also ask about their confidence in the existing evidence, and what additional data they would need to be confident in using invasive care for patients with CKD.
Relative advantage: Uptake will be higher for interventions that are perceived as having an unambiguous advantage over alternative treatments. Given the potential fear of providers of causing CA-AKI in patients with CKD, we will ask providers about how they assess risk for CA-AKI and how they weigh the risks and benefits of invasive care for ACS against those of medical therapy in patients with CKD.

CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUALS: It is important to understand how VA cardiologists’ and nephrologists’ beliefs influence the use of guideline-concordant invasive care for ACS in patients with CKD.
Knowledge and beliefs: We will assess providers’ knowledge of guidelines and empirical data supporting the use of invasive care in patients with CKD, and their attitudes towards use of such care in patients with CKD. 
Self-efficacy: Providers belief in their capability to achieve a desired outcome is an important factor in successful implementation. We will assess providers’ efficacy to identify patients with CKD for whom invasive treatment of ACS is appropriate. We will also assess providers’ efficacy for discussing relative risks and benefits of invasive versus medical therapy for ACS in patients with CKD.
 
INNER SETTING: The inner setting refers to the clinics and hospitals in which an intervention occurs.
Structural characteristics: Features such as the availability of space and equipment for an intervention, number of providers with relevant expertise, and co-location of relevant providers within an organization can all affect implementation. We will assess provider perspectives on these and other system factors that may be associated with differential use of invasive treatment in patients with CKD.  
Culture: Local norms surrounding a particular intervention may affect when that intervention is used. We will assess providers’ views on local norms regarding the use of invasive care in those with CKD, including perceptions of who should be consulted to determine appropriateness of invasive care for patients with CKD.

OUTER SETTING: The likelihood of an intervention being implemented may be influenced by factors outside the healthcare system (e.g., patients’ home circumstances, incentives). In our study, we consider outer setting to include anything beyond the hospital where Veterans present for treatment of ACS. 
Patient needs and resources: Undergoing invasive care may pose extra challenges to some patients (e.g., those with home, work, or social circumstances that are not conducive to allowing adequate recovery time). We will ask providers about whether and how they take into consideration the needs of their patients when deciding on use of invasive care, and whether the considerations vary for patients with CKD.
External policies and incentives: Guidelines, external mandates, public benchmarking, and pay-for-performance are often used to implement new interventions. We will ask providers whether and how guidelines affect the use of invasive care for ACS. We will also inquire about the impact of complications of invasive care on hospital performance measures, and whether there are hospital- and/or provider-specific incentives for minimizing complications that may cause providers to avoid the use of invasive care in patients with CKD.

To finalize the provider guide, we will re-assess these CFIR domains and factors and exclude or include other factors we find in quantitative analyses to be associated with use of invasive care in patients with CKD.

Assignment #3b: Measures & Evaluations
1. What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

My response to this is:
Aim 1 of our study is designed to confirm the disparity in care between Veterans with ACS based on their CKD status. The outcome for this aim is the use of invasive care in the setting of ACS, stratified by CKD status. Confirming the presence of this disparity is essential to the goal of identifying the reasons for the disparity and designing and implementing an intervention to reduce it. 

Aim 2 of our study will assess factors associated with the underutilization of invasive care in Veterans with CKD and ACS. The factors will be assessed using quantitative methods and semi-structured interviews with patients and providers. This mixed methods approach will enable us to comprehensive evaluate the relevant factors contributing to the disparity in care. 

Aim 3 of our study will assess mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, and kidney outcomes based on the receipt of invasive care among Veterans with CKD who do and do not receive invasive care. These outcomes were selected because they are highly patient-centered. Furthermore, an assessment of the balance between adverse cardiovascular outcomes and renal events is likely key to patient and provider decisions regarding the receipt and use of invasive care, respectively. 

2. What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

We will also be assessing the use of invasive care among patients with ACS and CKD who are deemed appropriate candidates for this care. We are performing this assessment as their are some patients with CKD and ACS that may appropriately not be considered good candidates for invasive care. Performing this analysis based on the appropriateness of care will assist in establishing the scope of the disparity problem and help shape the focus of the future intervention to reduce this disparity. 

3. Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not? 

As our study is a prelude to a future intervention to improve the implementation of evidence based care, we will not specifically be looking at any co-benefits or unintended consequences.

1.	What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?

In AIM 3. To measure de-implementation effectiveness, our approach will involve conducting a non-randomized controlled trial of ROUTT-B using a parallel experimental (Nationwide Children’s Hospital) and control (Children’s Hospital Colorado) interrupted time series study design extending over two-years of baseline and a one-year intervention period. A set of de-implementation strategies will be selected using ROUTT-B (the exact strategies and number of strategies will be based on the results of Aims 1 and 2). Then a local quality improvement team at NCH led by my collaborators will deploy the selected ROUTT-B de-implementation strategies during a one-year pilot.

This quasi-experimental design is the best design for several reasons. It is feasible given the time and funding constraints of the grant mechanism (AHRQ K08). More information is needed to inform and justify a larger experimental study design (such as multi-site cluster randomized or stepped-wedge cluster randomized).

Yes. In AIM 1, quantitative data will be used for purposive sampling for semi-structured interviews and other qualitative data collection. The qualitative data from AIM 1 will then be used to develop surveys to measure RE-AIM components in AIM 3.

What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?

Our proposal involves a retrospective cohort study and a mixed methods study. For the retrospective cohort study, we will develop a database comprising Veterans hospitalized at VA facilities with ACS over a 10-year period. We will categorize patients based on the presence/absence of CKD at the time of admission and evaluate differences in the use of invasive care based on CKD status, adjusting for the appropriateness of invasive care and other potential confounders (Aim 1). For the mixed methods study, we will conduct analyses using our study database, other VA sources, and data collected from VA facilities to quantitatively assess patient- and system-level factors associated with the use of invasive care in Veterans with CKD (Aim 2). Using data from these quantitative analyses and principles from the health care disparities and implementation science fields, we will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to guide semi-structured interviews with VA interventional cardiologists and nephrologists, as well as Veterans with a history of ACS. We believe this design is the best approach as it will allow us to capitalize on a large, robust database within the VA to definitively establish the presence of the disparity in care and failure of implementation of evidence based treatment. The mixed methods component will facilitate the incorporation of data from the CDW as well as information from both patients and providers to explore the underlying reasons for the disparity.

1. What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?

My response to this is:
I plan to use a stepped-wedge design (also known as dynamic wait-listed design).

This design is pragmatic when, as is the case with my study, it is predicted that the intervention will do more good than harm, hence making a parallel design unethical. 

Briefly, there will be an initial period in which no cluster (a unit at a study site) will be exposed to the intervention. We will then sequentially roll out the intervention in each facility. This will allow us to learn from each study site and adapt as necessary for the next sites. Eventually all study sites will have received the intervention, but the order in which the units receive the intervention will be determined at random.

2. Will you be incorporating a mixed methods design into your study? If so, what approach will you use to incorporate the qualitative data into the study (e.g., integrate the quantitative and qualitative data to inform your aims? If not, why?

My response to this is:
Yes, I plan to include mixed methods into my study. 

I plan to use a convergence design with data merging to integrate quantitative and qualitative data. 
I will concurrently collect quantitative data (for example proportion of clinicians who accept the intervention as reported from electronic health record) and qualitative data about acceptance of the intervention (from interviews and focus groups). I will then combine these data during the reporting of the study findings where qualitative verbatim quotations will be used to support or refute quantitative findings.

1.	What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?
Response: The proposed study design for our multi-level intervention to improve testosterone prescribing in the VA is a randomized controlled design. However, since this is a pilot study, this will be conducted at two VA sites with the intervention introduced at one site only with the other site serving as a comparison site. The intervention will be deployed at the site level to minimize issues of contamination. Further, we will use the hybrid study I framework for this study. 
	The reason for first using the randomized controlled design is because this is a multi-level intervention target the patients, clinicians, and site pharmacists it will work better to randomize whole sites to either receiving the intervention or not (control site). Also, the effects of the intervention both from the perspective of the clinical and implementation outcomes will be much easier to tease with the randomized nature of the design. This is a hybrid type I study as we are primarily interested in evaluating the effects of the clinical intervention (impact on 1-year guideline discordant testosterone prescriptions) and secondarily in conducting an assessment for implementation outcomes (reach, fidelity, adoption, and maintenance) of the intervention for future scale-up and spread.  

2.	Will you be incorporating a mixed methods design into your study? If so, what approach will you use to incorporate the qualitative data into the study (e.g., integrate the quantitative and qualitative data to inform your aims? If not, why?
Response: Yes, I will be incorporating a mixed methods design into my study. Our primary quantitative aim will aim to assess the effectiveness of the clinical intervention by examining the impact on change in 1-year guideline discordant testosterone prescriptions. Specifically, we will measure the percent of patients who discontinued their testosterone prescriptions and change in the overall percent of guideline-discordant testosterone prescriptions for the site using VA administrative data. Further, through post-intervention surveys with clinicians and pharmacists, we will assess the increase in clinician and pharmacist knowledge on evidence based testosterone practices and whether the intervention prompted discussion of the patient with the clinician about discontinuation. We will also use quantitative methods to assess the reach of the intervention in terms of percent of patients, clinicians, and pharmacists who received the intervention.
For our implementation outcomes, we will use primarily qualitative methods. Specifically, to assess the potential for future adoption and maintenance of our intervention, we will conduct post-intervention qualitative interviews with patients, clinicians, and leaders and administrative staff involved in its design and roll out to examine impressions of intervention in terms of its satisfaction, ease of use, barriers to adoption, suggestions for improvement. We will also assess fidelity through post-intervention with clinicians, pharmacist and leaders/staff to evaluate supports in place to ensure consistent delivery of the intervention. This implementation assessment of the intervention will be critical for future scale up and spread of the intervention to multiple VA sites as part of a larger study.

1.	What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?

My Response to this is:
  
The overall study design for my K12/TIDIRH project is a mixed methods design with concurrent qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis.  This is the best design to answer my research questions as I have questions about processes, context, and complexity.  Below I have outlined the proposed study designs for each of my 3 aims as well as the rationale for each of those study designs.  

Aim 1:  Existing:  Assess acceptability of SIBR and CPW implementation from the patient perspective using validated survey tools. 

Aim 1: Revised:  Assess acceptability of SIBR and CPW implementation from the patient and family perspective using an embedded sequential exploratory design (qualitative interviews followed by surveys).  

Proposed Study Design:  I am currently in the process of shifting this aim from being a cross-sectional descriptive study design (using surveys) to using an embedded sequential exploratory design where I start with qualitative interviews with patients and family members (and some demographic data) prior to determining what types of questions would be appropriate to include in subsequent surveys.  

Why is this the best design?: One of the knowledge gaps in this area is whether patient’s have a preference between traditional rounding approaches (e.g. rounds occur in hallway or a limited group of team members i.e. attending and resident only are present) and interprofessional team-based bedside rounding approaches. Patient perspectives on and experiences of clinical pathways are also not well-understood. I have a meeting with primary K12 mentor this coming week and my entire mentorship committee next week where we’ll discuss this further and come to consensus with regards to a plan and timeline but I am increasingly convinced that starting with a qualitative approach for this aim would be more appropriate than starting with existing validated surveys of patient perspectives on teamwork or patient-centeredness of care.  

Aim 2: Explore acceptability and appropriateness of SIBR, CPWs & SIBR + CPW integration from the perspective of providers (attending physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) for whom SIBR and CPW implementation represent a need to de-implement previous rounding and care practices.

Proposed Study Design:  Qualitative design using semi-structured interviews 

Why is this the best design?: This is a topic that has not yet been explored at all in the literature and it is not yet known what provider perspectives are on SIBR rounds, particularly from the perspective of de-implementation.  

Aim 3: Determine rates of CPW adoption/penetration (uptake and ongoing utilization) at UWMC on two AHF services where SIBR is the standard of practice.
Proposed Study Design:  Hybrid Trial Type 1—primary aim = testing effectiveness of clinical pathway implementation to improve patient care/outcomes;  secondary aim = collecting information about implementation process (though observations and meetings with implementers)

Why is this the best design?: At the current stage of my research and the current stage of implementation within my partner healthcare system this is the best design because the healthcare system has developed the clinical pathway and is promoting its adoption and utilization.  My hypothesis is that clinical pathway adoption will be more successful in those units that utilize SIBR.  I will be carrying out clinical observations of rounds as well as discussing CPW utilization with implementers at the administrative and clinical care team levels. 
 
2.	Will you be incorporating a mixed methods design into your study? If so, what approach will you use to incorporate the qualitative data into the study (e.g., integrate the quantitative and qualitative data to inform your aims? If not, why?

My Response to this is:  

As described above, I will be incorporating a mixed methods design into my study at the level of each aim as well as overall.  In Aim 1, I am planning to add qualitative interviews with patients/families which will inform development of a survey that can be deployed on a larger scale.  Aim 2 is completely qualitative and results will inform my future plans for implementation strategies related to SIBR and CPW’s.  Aim 3 is also mixed methods in that I will be carrying out observations of rounds (which include a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data) in settings that have already adopted SIBR and that are in the process of implementing CPW’s. I will also utilize clinical dashboard data to track utilization of CPWs by unit/service.

Aim 2 is completely qualitative and results will inform my future plans for implementation strategies related to SIBR and CPW’s.  Aim 3 is also mixed methods in that I will be carrying out observations of rounds (which include a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data) in settings that have already adopted SIBR and that are in the process of implementing CPW’s.

1.	What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?
My response to this is: We will use a within-site pre-post design. This is the best design because we will be studying the implementation of a protocol for measuring the intensity of physical therapy activities in the home health setting. At this stage, we are working with therapists within a single home health agency. Our primary objectives are focused on identifying the implementation strategies that maximize 1) fidelity and 2) sustainability of measuring intensity of home health physical therapy activities.


2.	Will you be incorporating a mixed methods design into your study? If so, what approach will you use to incorporate the qualitative data into the study (e.g., integrate the quantitative and qualitative data to inform your aims? If not, why? 
My response to this is: We will use a mixed methods study design. We will be simultaneously collecting qualitative and quantitative data and will be giving equal weight to both. The qualitative data will be used for expansion of the quantitative data and will be embedded in quantitative data collection. We will be collecting quantitative data on the fidelity of the implemented intervention (measurement of intensity of physical therapy activities in the home health setting) and qualitative data on barriers to fidelity. The qualitative data will be used to adapt the intervention and fidelity will be used to determine success of the adaptation.

1. If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?

My response to this is:

The specific implementation strategy I propose will be housed in the existing antimicrobial stewardship (AS) program and will involve a medication reconciliation approach.  In this approach, a pharmacist member of the AS team will review proton pump inhibitor (PPI) orders and as applicable, send a PPI stewardship recommendation to the provider to discontinue PPI use or switch an alternative medication using the electronic medical record (EMR). We will make adaptions to the intervention as we receive feedback from clinicians.

I selected this intervention strategy through discussions with research team members from our research group many of whom have extensive experience with AS. 


2. How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?

My response to this is:

Our intervention will be administered through the EMR, after a medication reconciliation, a pharmacist member will send a PPI stewardship recommendation to the provider. 
There is evidence to suggest that in this context clinicians experience “alert burden.” We think that integrating this intervention in an already existing AS will reduce the “alert burden” to clinicians.

In brief, my proposed implementation strategy falls in two broad categories by Waltz, et al., 2015. i.e., supporting clinicians and adapting & tailoring to context.

3. If your proposed study does not involve selecting implementation strategies but you are evaluating the outcomes of exposure to a program or policy implemented by others (e.g., natural experiment), how will you measure key differences in implementation variation such as by time, population, setting/location, dose or, content?

My response to this is:

This is not applicable to my study as I will directly select and apply an implementation strategy.

1.	If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?
Response: Since this is pilot study involving a multi-level intervention targeting the patient, clinicians, and system, I plan to focus on the following implementation strategy in the format recommended by Proctor et al., 2013. 
a.	Name of implementation strategy: Assess for readiness and identify barriers and facilitators 
Define the implementation strategy: Assess various aspects of an organization to determine its degree of readiness to implement, barriers that may impede 
Specify the implementation strategy: 
Actor: Intervention developer familiar with the intervention and closely involved in implementing the intervention in the intervention site
Action: Observe and summarize patient-, clinician-, and site-level characteristics, site culture and context to determine barriers and facilitators for the implementation of the intervention at each level
Target of the intervention: Patients, clinicians, pharmacists receiving the intervention and site staff and key leaders who are involved in rolling out the intervention in the site.
Temporality: Assessment should begin two weeks after the start of the intervention
Dose: Once monthly for 1 hour for the first six months
Implementation outcomes affected: Adoption, maintenance, and fidelity
Justification: Since this is small-scale pilot study, assessment for readiness and identification of barriers and facilitators potentially is a pragmatic strategy to use as this assessment will provide important data information for adoption and maintenance of the implementation of the intervention for future scale up and spread. 

b.	Name of implementation strategy: Identify and prepare champions 
Define the implementation strategy: Identify and prepare individuals who dedicate themselves to supporting, marketing, and driving through an implementation, overcoming indifference or resistance that the intervention may provoke in an organization
Specify the implementation strategy: 
Actor: Intervention developers familiar with the intervention and closely involved in implementing the intervention in the intervention site
Action: Observe the patients, clinicians, pharmacists, and site leadership and staff involved and identify individuals who can play this champion role.  
Target of the intervention: Patients, clinicians, pharmacists receiving the intervention and site staff and key leaders who are involved in rolling out the intervention in the site.
Temporality: Debriefing/discussion on potential participants who can play this role should begin two weeks after the start of the intervention
Dose: Once monthly for 1 hour for the first six months
Implementation outcomes affected: Adoption, maintenance, and fidelity
Justification: Since this is small-scale pilot study, identification and preparation of champions potentially is a promising strategy to facilitate adoption, maintenance, and fidelity of implementation of the intervention. 

2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?
Response: For my study, I linked the specific implementation strategies mentioned above by keeping in consideration the scale of the study, what implementation outcomes I am measuring and by targeting which participants these outcomes (i.e. adoption, maintenance, and fidelity) will be strengthened.

The aim of my study is to develop a menu of de-implementation strategies linked to a list of potential contextual factors. The resulting menu of targeted de-implementation strategies will help future teams plan for and successfully de-implement non-recommended tests and treatments in their setting by guiding the selection of appropriate evidence-based strategies tailored to local influencing factors. I therefore am submitting my proposed approach to my second aim for this assignment. 

AIM 2: Develop ROUTT- B, a set of feasible and effective de-implementation strategies for bronchiolitis 
Introduction: To be effective, ROUTT-B must be both specific to unique contexts and adaptable to changing contexts. In this study, bronchiolitis is being used as a case to develop ROUTT-B, but the strategies developed for ROUTT-B are intended to be generalizable to other diseases and contexts. Systematically matching a broad inventory of influencing factors with feasible and effective de-implementation strategies will result in a generalizable and highly adaptive menu of de-implementation strategies. The objective of this Aim is to match organizational-, patient-, and provider-level contextual influencing factors with pragmatic, evidence-based
behavior-change techniques or system level de-implementation strategies that can be feasibly implemented depending on an organization’s available resources (Figure 5). Approach: Using PRISM as a guide, I will work 
Figure 5: Sample Influencing Factors Matched to Example De-Implementation Strategies
Factors Influencing Overuse or the Failure to De-Implement Tests and Treatments		Potential De-implementation strategy
Providers feel they are already providing guideline concordant care		Share provider-level data compared to peers
Ordering tests for bronchiolitis is something providers sometimes do without thinking		Providers sign a public pledge to not order unnecessary tests and treatments in bronchiolitis
Providers don’t have a clear plan of how they will deliver guideline concordant care when families request tests/treatments		Tools, resources, and outreach materials for parents to enhance understanding and acceptance of when “less is more”
Order sets promote overuse by making it easy to order non-recommended tests and treatments 		Order sets and best-practice alerts that align with guideline recommendations
Providers feel influenced by other providers in the organization to order tests and treatments 		Promote stories/narrative of local opinion leaders  
Stakeholders perceive unintended consequences or negative impacts of de-implementation on outcomes 	
Share data on patient outcomes (avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics) and balancing measures
with a small number of experts in quality improvement (QI) and implementation science research (including QI leaders at both study sites, my mentors and advisors, and others as needed). Together we will identify behavior change techniques and system level de-implementation strategies to address potentially actionable influencing factors (identified in Aim 1). This will be a multi-step process. Throughout the process, when appropriate, we will choose strategies previously recommended or proven effective for addressing a given influencing factor.52,81-84 85-88 First, we will categorize influencing factors by level (patient, provider, and organization) and PRISM domain. Next, we will use the CFIR-ERIC (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research - Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change) Matching Tool v1.0 to choose de-implementation strategies targeted to the muli-level (patient, provider, and organizational) influencing factors identified in AIM 1. The CFIR-ERIC Matching Tool contains 73 implementation strategies from ERIC mapped to the CFIR D&I framework constructs based on expert consensus. There is sufficient overlap between the CFIR constructs and PRISM domains to allow for this mapping. We will then consider and add additional de-implementation strategies not contained in ERIC (e.g. the provider pledge which was an effective and novel de-implementaton strategy used in our pilot). Next, where multiple de-implementaton strategies address a given influencing factor, we will prioritize strategies based on: 1) stakeholder perceptions of the acceptability and appropriateness of the potential de-implementation strategies (from Aim 1), 2) evidence-level, and 3) implementation cost (where it is known). Iterative changes will be made to the menu of influencing factors and linked de-implementation strategies contained in ROUTT-B until consensus is reached. Limitations and Alternate Approaches:  Although the behavior change and system-level de-implementation strategies used to develop ROUTT-B will be evidence-based when possible, evidence may not be available to guide the selection of every strategy included in ROUTT-B. The CFIR-ERIC matching tool is based on expert consensus. The tool may not recommend strategies for all influencing factors identified and may not include all possible strategies.

If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them? <br />2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?<br /><br />The aim of my study is to develop a menu of de-implementation strategies linked to a list of potential contextual factors. The resulting menu of targeted de-implementation strategies will help future teams plan for and successfully de-implement non-recommended tests and treatments in their setting by guiding the selection of appropriate evidence-based strategies tailored to local influencing factors. I therefore am submitting my proposed approach to my second aim for this assignment. <br /><br />AIM 2: Develop ROUTT- B, a set of feasible and effective de-implementation strategies for bronchiolitis <br />Introduction: To be effective, ROUTT-B must be both specific to unique contexts and adaptable to changing contexts. In this study, bronchiolitis is being used as a case to develop ROUTT-B, but the strategies developed for ROUTT-B are intended to be generalizable to other diseases and contexts. Systematically matching a broad inventory of influencing factors with feasible and effective de-implementation strategies will result in a generalizable and highly adaptive menu of de-implementation strategies. The objective of this Aim is to match organizational-, patient-, and provider-level contextual influencing factors with pragmatic, evidence-based<br />behavior-change techniques or system level de-implementation strategies that can be feasibly implemented depending on an organization’s available resources (Figure 5). Approach: Using PRISM as a guide, I will work <br />Figure 5: Sample Influencing Factors Matched to Example De-Implementation Strategies<br />Factors Influencing Overuse or the Failure to De-Implement Tests and Treatments		Potential De-implementation strategy<br />Providers feel they are already providing guideline concordant care		Share provider-level data compared to peers<br />Ordering tests for bronchiolitis is something providers sometimes do without thinking		Providers sign a public pledge to not order unnecessary tests and treatments in bronchiolitis<br />Providers don’t have a clear plan of how they will deliver guideline concordant care when families request tests/treatments		Tools, resources, and outreach materials for parents to enhance understanding and acceptance of when “less is more”<br />Order sets promote overuse by making it easy to order non-recommended tests and treatments 		Order sets and best-practice alerts that align with guideline recommendations<br />Providers feel influenced by other providers in the organization to order tests and treatments 		Promote stories/narrative of local opinion leaders  <br />Stakeholders perceive unintended consequences or negative impacts of de-implementation on outcomes 	<br />Share data on patient outcomes (avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics) and balancing measures<br />with a small number of experts in quality improvement (QI) and implementation science research (including QI leaders at both study sites, my mentors and advisors, and others as needed). Together we will identify behavior change techniques and system level de-implementation strategies to address potentially actionable influencing factors (identified in Aim 1). This will be a multi-step process. Throughout the process, when appropriate, we will choose strategies previously recommended or proven effective for addressing a given influencing factor.52,81-84 85-88 First, we will categorize influencing factors by level (patient, provider, and organization) and PRISM domain. Next, we will use the CFIR-ERIC (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research - Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change) Matching Tool v1.0 to choose de-implementation strategies targeted to the muli-level (patient, provider, and organizational) influencing factors identified in AIM 1. The CFIR-ERIC Matching Tool contains 73 implementation strategies from ERIC mapped to the CFIR D&amp;I framework constructs based on expert consensus. There is sufficient overlap between the CFIR constructs and PRISM domains to allow for this mapping. We will then consider and add additional de-implementation strategies not contained in ERIC (e.g. the provider pledge which was an effective and novel de-implementaton strategy used in our pilot). Next, where multiple de-implementaton strategies address a given influencing factor, we will prioritize strategies based on: 1) stakeholder perceptions of the acceptability and appropriateness of the potential de-implementation strategies (from Aim 1), 2) evidence-level, and 3) implementation cost (where it is known). Iterative changes will be made to the menu of influencing factors and linked de-implementation strategies contained in ROUTT-B until consensus is reached. Limitations and Alternate Approaches:  Although the behavior change and system-level de-implementation strategies used to develop ROUTT-B will be evidence-based when possible, evidence may not be available to guide the selection of every strategy included in ROUTT-B. The CFIR-ERIC matching tool is based on expert consensus. The tool may not recommend strategies for all influencing factors identified and may not include all possible strategies. The tool, however, provides a starting point from which to build an evidence base for tailored de-implementation strategies. Changes will be made to the strategies in ROUTT-B as needed based on Aim 3 results. Expected outcomes: ROUTT-B will help teams successfully de-implement non-recommended tests/treatments in their setting or context by guiding the selection of appropriate evidence-based strategies targeted to unique contextual influencing factors.";s:6:"parent";N;s:7:"replies";a:1:{i:0;s:32:"f08429f3741e690982e7f5d0aa64c744";}s:4:"show";b:1;s:3:"cid";s:32:"a77955f19821cb5c8e9eb879c25ece42";}s:32:"d43c529d993f26a1f3494b600b54e997";a:8:{s:4:"user";a:5:{s:2:"id";s:9:"eblakeney";s:4:"name";s:13:"Erin Blakeney";s:4:"mail";s:12:"erin2@uw.edu";s:7:"address";s:0:"";s:3:"url";s:0:"";}s:4:"date";a:1:{s:7:"created";i:1539970418;}s:3:"raw";s:3170:"BLAKENEY- Assignment #5:

1.	If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?

My Response to this is:  While I am not the one implementing either structured interprofessional bedside rounds (SIBR) or clinical pathways (CPW’s) in the context of this project, I am studying aspects of implementation of both including the strategies that have been used to implement.  I have responded about how I plan to address these in my response to question #3 below.  

2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?

My Response to this is:  For both aims 1 and 2 I will be interviewing stakeholders (in aim 1 patients and families) in aim 2 (providers) to better understand their perspective on both SIBR and CPW’s as well as the strategies used in the implementation of those interventions.  While people experienced in organizational change management and who have clinical expertise in heart failure have been involved in both implementations (including myself in the SIBR implementation over the past 4 years as part of another grant) the main strategy that has been used was ISLAGIATT model (“it seemed like a good idea at the time”) that Prajakta Adsul described in the voiceover powerpoint for this module.  One of my goals in this project is to better understand the context and stakeholders so that in future efforts we can more intentionally link specific implementation strategies to the context and then evaluate the effectiveness of those strategies. 

3.	If your proposed study does not involve selecting implementational strategies but you are evaluating the outcomes of exposure to a program or policy implemented by others (e.g., natural experiment), how will you measure key differences in implementation variation such as by time, population, setting/location, dose or, content?

My Response to this is:  The focus of my study is on implementation outcomes as defined by Proctor et al (acceptability, appropriateness in aims 1 & 2 from the perspectives of patients/families and providers; adoption/penetration of CPW’s in a SIBR context in aim 3).  I will include questions about SIBR and CPW implementation in aims 1 and 2 to better understand the perceptions of implementation strategies that were utilized (e.g. have patients received educational handouts, orientations to units, and if yes, have they found them helpful?; have providers participated in trainings, do they know how to access educational materials, do they find them helpful?).  The goal of including questions like these in the interviews will be to be able to tailor future strategies to better meet their needs.  

For the third aim I will be carrying out clinical observations (and using a semi-structured observation tool) to better understand the extent to which there is fidelity to SIBR as well as whether CPW’s are discussed during rounds.  Observations will help me to better understand differences within and between two cardiology services in terms of rounds timing, population, setting/location, dose, content, etc.

1.	If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?
My response to this is: We will use an adaptive approach and modify existing and/or develop additional implementation strategies in response to barriers and facilitators identified (see response to Question 2). The initial implementation strategies we are planning are listed below.

a)	Assess for readiness and identify barriers and facilitators. 
Operationalization: 
•	Assess readiness for change at administrative and therapist levels 
•	Conduct needs assessment among intervention therapists
•	Conduct on-site observations (shadow home health therapists) and group interviews to identify barriers to implementation

b)	Make training dynamic
Operationalization: 
•	Use active learning principles (e.g., role play) to train therapists on standardized approach to intensity

c)	Distribute educational materials
Operationalization:
•	Distribute electronic and print reference manuals on protocol

d)	Audit and provide feedback
Operationalization:
•	Generate and distribute weekly reports on content and frequency adherence and monthly reports on coverage

e)	Obtain and use patients’ feedback
Operationalization:
•	Semi-structured interviews with active participants in the intervention to identify issues/preferences

f)	Organize clinician implementation team meetings
Operationalization:
•	Organize monthly meetings among intervention therapists to address issues and share tips/advice

2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?
My response to this is: We will use the CFIR domains and constructs to develop key informant interview guides for the pre-implementation (planning), facilitated implementation, and sustainability phases. We will use the CFIR as a coding framework for all qualitative analyses. During the pre-implementation and facilitated implementation phases, findings from qualitative analyses will be used for formative evaluation. We will map the barriers identified within each domain/construct to implementation strategies using the CFIR-ERIC Matching Tool v1.0. We will track and report the following components of implementation strategies: actor, action, action target, temporality, dose, implementation outcome affected, and justification.

1.If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?
Our study will not focus on a specific implementation strategy. At the current time, the focus of the proposal is to:
1) determine if there is a disparity in the use of invasive care between patients with acute coronary syndrome based on the presence vs. absence of underlying chronic kidney disease
2) If a disparity exists as we hypothesize, identify patient-level, provider-level, and/or system-level factors that underlie the disparity. 


2.How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?
My response:
The determination of which implementation strategies that best fit the ultimate goal (i.e, enhance the use of nvasive care in patients with acute coronary syndrome and chronic kidney disease) will be dependent upon what is found in the currently proposed analyses on the causes of the disparity in care. 


3.If your proposed study does not involve selecting implementational strategies but you are evaluating the outcomes of exposure to a program or policy implemented by others (e.g., natural experiment), how will you measure key differences in implementation variation such as by time, population, setting/location, dose or, content?
My response:
We will be analyzing differences in the use of invasive care between patients with and without chronic kidney disease by:
- confirmation that patients had an underlying indication for invasive care (i.e., acute coronary syndrome)
- determining the appropriateness of invasive care based on GRACE 2.0 scores calculated from administrative data
- comparison of rates of use of invasive care between patients with and without chronic kidney disease who were deemed appropriate candidates for that care
