Working Title: Exploring Adaptations of Culturally-Tailored Inoculation Message Approaches to Increase Resistance to Tobacco Marketing Among Young Adult Sexual Minority Women at Multiple Levels of Intervention

Background and Rationale
Young adult sexual minority women (SMW), including lesbians and bisexuals, are at particularly high risk, with up to 4.8 times increased odds of cigarette smoking than heterosexual women; up to 660,000 young adult SMW smoke and are at increased risks of smoking-related cancers and cardiopulmonary illnesses. Effective strategies are urgently needed to reduce smoking among young adult SMW. Exposure to tobacco industry marketing, minority stressors ((i.e., victimization, internalized homophobia, and concealment), alcohol and drug use and social determinants are key factors linked to increased smoking behavior in this population. National anti-smoking campaigns utilized inoculation messages (analogous to vaccines) and culturally-tailoring (i.e., LGBTQ imagery, symbols, and language) to promote resilience against tobacco marketing influences among LGBTQ audiences. The inoculation approach mirrors the national truth® campaign, which increased youth’s resistance to tobacco marketing and reduced smoking through anti-industry beliefs and attitudes. However, there is limited research on contextual factors and processes that influence adaptation and implementation of this approach to target young adult SMW specifically who experience unique stressors and have different information needs related to smoking and cessation. In addition, the intersections of sexual identity, race, ethnicity, and geographic backgrounds in influencing smoking behavior and responses to anti-smoking messaging among young adult SMW have not been evaluated. Understanding these unique needs and characteristics of the target audience and the perspectives of stakeholders at multiple levels of intervention (e.g., LGBTQ community organizations, healthcare systems, and policy) would provide critically needed evidence to inform specific adaptations of the inoculation approach and improve adoption, implementation and maintenance at each of these levels.

Dissemination and Implementation Gaps
1)	What specific adaptations to the inoculation messaging approach (e.g., use of culturally-tailored symbols, imagery, and language) are perceived as acceptable and effective among young adult SMW smokers and non-smokers? What are the perceptions of these adaptations among young adult SMW audiences across diverse racial, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds?
2)	What specific adaptations of the inoculation messaging approach do stakeholders and implementer organizations at multiple levels and settings (e.g., LGBTQ community organization, health center serving LGBTQ patient populations, state or national health agencies) perceive as feasible and sustainable? What are the perceptions of these adaptations among stakeholders across different levels of intervention and practice settings?
3)	What specific adaptations to the inoculation messaging approach would increase the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the approach by implementer organizations at the community, healthcare, and policy levels?
4)	What are the contextual factors and processes (e.g., sociopolitical, funding, organizational characteristics, decision maker characteristics, population served) that influence the ability of implementer organizations at multiple levels and different settings to adapt and implement the inoculation messaging approach for young adult SMW? 

Specific Aims
The specific aims of this D&I study are:
Aim 1: Explore specific adaptations of the inoculation messaging approach to promote resilience against smoking among young adult SMW that are perceived as acceptable and effective among young adult SMW audiences from diverse backgrounds. 

To address Aim 1, We will conduct 16 online focus groups (N=12 participants each, ~90 minutes) using the Facebook closed groups approach described in prior research. Online focus groups were chosen to maximize the enrolment of participants across diverse geographic regions and demographic background. Recruitment will occur through Facebook advertising and at LGBTQ events through partner LGBTQ organizations. We planned for 16 groups organized into lesbian vs. bisexual women, smoker vs. non-smoker status, non-Hispanic white vs. racial and ethnic minority, rural vs. urban participants to obtain perspectives from young adult SMW across diverse backgrounds. We will use a semi-structured guide comprising questions on the salience of inoculation messages obtained from existing LGBTQ-targeted anti-smoking campaigns, message appeal, perceived effectiveness, relevance to increasing resilience, negative effects, and suggestions for adaptation of these messages for young adult SMW audiences.

Aim 2:  Explore specific adaptations of the inoculation messaging approach that are perceived as feasible and sustainable among potential implementer organizations and stakeholders (e.g., young adult SMW community leaders, LGBTQ organization leaders, tobacco control advocates, clinicians, researchers, and public health agencies (e.g., CDC and FDA)).

Aim 3: Describe contextual factors and processes that either facilitate or impede the ability of stakeholders and organizations to adapt and implement the inoculation messaging approach to reduce smoking among young adult SMW at the community, healthcare, and policy levels.

To address Aims 2 and 3, we will convene an Expert Advisory Committee (EAC), comprising LGBTQ organization leaders, sexual and gender minority health researchers, SMW community leaders, and representatives from national agencies (NCI, CDC, and FDA) to collect data regarding implementation context (e.g., characteristics of decision makers and organizations) and to inform adaptations to the inoculation messaging approach that would best suit the level and setting of intervention from their perspectives. The EAC members will be selected to represent individuals who have a high-level view of the specific context in which the inoculation messaging approach could be implemented within their organization to reduce young adult SMW smoking and to represent diverse organization type, expertise in health promotion among LGBTQ populations, levels of intervention, and geographic regions. We anticipate to conduct ~15 interviews among EAC members. 

Importance to the Field
The successful completion of this study will provide important Design for Dissemination information for developing training sessions, tools, and technical support to assist organizations and build capacity across different levels of intervention and settings to adapt, pre-test, and implement the inoculation messaging approach to target the population of young adult SMW that they serve.

Working Title: Preventing Substance Use Among Youth: Developing an Enhanced Implementation Strategy for Community Schools

Health Problem 
Alcohol, tobacco and other drug (ATOD) use remains a major public health problem among youth in the U.S.[2] Adolescence marks a time of life with high rates of ATOD use that contribute to concerning rates of morbidity and mortality [9, 15]. In addition, substance use disorders among young people incur high social, emotional and economic cost to individuals, families, communities and society; preventing substance use and its consequences can potentially reduce this burden by avoiding or tempering disorders in many individuals [11]. School-based prevention programs offer tremendous opportunity to reach large populations of adolescents, including those underserved by other settings (e.g., youth from low resource communities).[10] The field of drug abuse prevention has made tremendous gains in developing evidence-based approaches to reducing youth substance use [4]. These programs may be especially important for young people with a history of marginalization, trauma, and poverty who are at great risk of later ATOD misuse and substance use disorders, with limited access to resources for treatment and prevention [7]. 

Evidence-based practice, program, intervention or guideline
The Michigan Model for Health (MMH) is the comprehensive, evidence-based K-12 health curriculum for the State of Michigan that has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing risk of negative outcomes such as ATOD use and conduct problems and increasing the likelihood of positive social behavior [12, 16]. The MMH curriculum is recognized by Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL)[1] and the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices [17]. In addition, MMH is aligned to both State of Michigan and National Health Education standards. Prevailing policy and practice has encouraged its adoption within many Michigan school districts. The program is grounded in Social Learning Theory and the Health Belief Model, and it addresses several developmentally appropriate cognitive, social-emotional, attitudinal, and contextual factors related to health behaviors [12, 16]. The high school MMH curriculum includes core content areas focused on alcohol, tobacco and other drugs (ATOD) as well as social and emotional health, and skill development. MMH has been widely adopted throughout the State of Michigan: 72% of public schools report delivering 4-5 MMH core content areas in 9th grade.

Dissemination or implementation gap
Funders have invested considerable resources in interventions to prevent negative outcomes among youth [8, 14]. Drug abuse prevention researchers have concluded that the success of evidence-based prevention interventions depends, in part, on the quality of their implementation [4]. Yet, youth rarely receive evidence-based interventions (EBIs) as intended in community settings [7]. For example, although 76% of 9th grade public school students received the MMH unit on ATOD use, 58% of educators did not meet state-designated fidelity requirements[16]. Results from a recent survey indicate that this may be even lower in resource-challenged communities, with only 27% meeting state fidelity requirements in Genesee County, MI [5]. The current paradigm for intervention development focuses disproportionately on program efficacy and less on delivery of EBIs with fidelity in real-world community contexts [6]. This paradigm contributes to the widely acknowledged research-to-practice gap, and limits societal benefits from significant intervention research investments [3, 15]. Low-resource settings face additional challenges, as they often have low capacity for program delivery, which undermines intervention implementation and, ultimately, desired behavioral outcomes [11]. Researchers acknowledge that prevention programs must be complemented by evidence-based implementation strategies (e.g., Replicating Effective Programs: REP) to achieve desired public health outcomes [9]. Implementation strategies, however, have been rarely applied to ATOD prevention in schools.

Specific Aims
The objective of the proposed study is to develop and pilot test tailored implementation strategies guided by implementation science frameworks to enhance fidelity of a widely disseminated, state-adopted high school health curriculum, the Michigan Model for Health® (MMH). My research question is as follows: Is enhanced REP a feasible, acceptable and appropriate implementation strategy to deliver a school-based health curriculum for adolescents?
1.	Aim 1: Develop a tailored implementation strategy guided by implementation science frameworks. Standard MMH delivery currently includes key REP components, including a manual, standardized training and as needed technical assistance. We will integrate end-user input into enhanced REP for additional tailoring and facilitation using data from an existing mixed method study of MMH implementation; this study was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Implementation Outcomes Framework (IOF) and identifies critical barriers to program implementation. 
2.	Aim 2: Conduct an implementation pilot study comparing REP and E-REP to deliver a school-based prevention program (MMH). We will conduct an implementation pilot study to examine using standard (e.g., REP: usual care) and enhanced REP (E-REP) to deliver MMH in high schools. We will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness of the implementation strategies for an ATOD prevention program. We will also compare the effectiveness of REP and E-REP on student substance use outcomes, including alcohol, marijuana and prescription drug misuse and MMH fidelity. The results of the pilot study will be the basis of an R01.
Importance to the field
This proposal extends current implementation science research through applying specific implementation frameworks to focus on non-clinical settings and prevention programs for youth, and advance research on evidence-based implementation strategies in school contexts. In addition, the proposed research will focus on youth living in low-resource communities, who are at disproportionate risk of negative outcomes. The results are expected to have positive impact because addressing these gaps will contribute to the effective integration of substance use prevention EBIs in diverse settings serving broad populations of youth. Ultimately this will have positive public health impact by preventing and reducing detrimental outcomes among youth.

Working Title: IMPROVING HEALTHY CANTEEN POLICY IMPLEMENTATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS
Health problem:
Globally, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents aged 5-19 years has risen, from 11 million in 1975 to 124 million in 2016. In Australia, one in four children under 18 years of age are overweight or obese with prevalence highest amongst adolescents, reaching 28% of 12-15 year olds and 33% of 16-17 year olds. Excess body weight in adolescents tends to track into adulthood increasing the risk of a range of chronic physical and psychosocial health conditions. Poor dietary habits, in particular added sugars, are amongst the key drivers of excessive weight gain in adolescents. Studies have shown that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) such as soft drinks, energy drinks and sports drinks tend to be the primary source of added sugar in adolescent diets. Consistent with SSB intake reported in other developed countries, a recent 2012 national survey of Australian adolescents indicate SSB consumption peaks in 14-18 year olds, with 51% males and 38% females in this age group consuming SSB the day prior to the survey. Similarly, nearly a third of adolescents in New South Wales, Australia consume two to six cups of soft drink per week contributing between 52g and 156g of added sugar a week.

Evidence-based practice, program, intervention or guideline:
Recent reviews and trials suggest that improving the relative availability of healthy foods and beverages, particularly in schools, is effective in reducing the prevalence of child overweight and obesity and/or its behavioural determinants. Schools are recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a critical setting to improve public health nutrition and to reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain in childhood. A number of trials utilising a multi-strategic approach, using the Theoretical Domains Framework to map barriers to intervention strategies, have been effective in improving healthy canteen policy implementation in primary schools. Effectiveness of these interventions has also been measured through student purchasing behaviour resulting in a significant decrease in total fat and improvements in total energy and sodium intake from purchases. Whilst there is a growing evidence base of effective strategies to improve the adoption of healthy canteen policies in Australian primary schools, little is known on the acceptability or effectiveness of these strategies in Australian secondary schools. Additionally, whilst studies have reported barriers to implementation of a healthy canteen policy in Australian primary schools, little evidence is available on the barriers secondary schools face when implementing such a policy. A pilot trial conducted by the research team is currently assessing school Principal and canteen staff perceptions of barriers to policy implementation and acceptability of implementation support.

Dissemination or implementation gap:
Whilst many countries have introduced school based healthy eating policies aimed at increasing the availability of healthier foods and beverages and restricting the availability of less healthy items, research indicates that adherence to such policies is limited. For example, a recent review (2016) of the adoption of healthy school food policies in Australian schools found that adherence with state-wide policies was low.  Research focusing on the implementation of school healthy eating policies in primary schools, has identified lack of executive support, concerns over profitability, lack of skills and knowledge needed to identify healthier menu items and the complexity of policy guidelines as common barriers to policy implementation. Secondary school canteen staff and principals have identified the difficulty in determining the ‘healthiness’ of canteen items, concerns regarding profitability, lack of resources, lack of support from the wider school community and a lack of demand from students as impeding policy implementation. A recent audit of 53 online secondary school canteen menus in the state of New South Wales, Australia, found none were compliant with the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy and only eight schools had no SSB for sale. Additionally, evidence regarding the effectiveness of school-based interventions to reduce SSB consumption is limited.

Specific Aims:
Primary Outcome: To assess the effectiveness of ‘performance monitoring and feedback’ versus ‘canteen staff training’ as part of a multi-component intervention in increasing secondary school implementation of the NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy.
The study will employ a factorial trial design to primarily test the effectiveness of i) performance monitoring and feedback versus ii) canteen staff training. Both of these strategies have been included collectively in effective multi-strategic interventions in primary schools, however, the role and influence each plays individually in improving policy implementation is unknown. Therefore, schools will be randomly allocated to one of four groups;
a) 10 month (4 school terms) implementation intervention including performance monitoring and feedback, gaining executive support, tools and resources and on-going implementation support via text messages/emails.
b) 10 month (4 school terms) implementation intervention including canteen staff training, gaining executive support, tools and resources and on-going implementation support via text messages/emails.
c) A combination of all strategies from groups a and b.
d) Control group 
Data will be collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention and 12 months post-intervention. The effectiveness of the intervention will be determined by comparing differences between groups in the proportion of schools compliant with the NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy via canteen menu audits. 

Secondary Outcomes: a) To assess the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention in decreasing the intake of SSB by secondary school students located in the state of NSW, Australia.
Data will be collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention and 12 months post-intervention. The effectiveness of the intervention will be determined by comparing differences between groups in student self-report SSB consumption via an online survey.
b) To assess 'Implementation Outcomes' such as acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity and penetration via a telephone survey with school Principals and canteen staff.
The RE-AIM evaluation model will be used to guide the trial outcomes and ensure a comprehensive evaluation process. 

Importance to field:
The increase in SSB consumption in children, particularly in adolescents, presents a problem of increasing priority, with evidence showing a strong association between SSB consumption and unhealthy weight gain and increased risk of overweight and obesity. Interventions to reduce the consumption of SSB amongst adolescents in particular are urgently needed to reduce the associated health burden. Policies have been introduced within schools restricting the sale of unhealthy foods and beverages such as SSB however implementation of such policies has been limited. As child and adolescence eating behaviours track into adulthood, the public health benefits of healthy eating policies such as those found in schools, will not be realised if implementation does not take place at a population level, across entire jurisdictions. This study will extend the current evidence base on implementation strategies to support school’s successful adoption of healthy eating policies, by providing evidence of effectiveness in secondary schools, who until now have not been the focus of research in this setting.

Reilly Assignment #2
1. Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?

Fidelity of the delivery of the implementation intervention will be measured through project records which our team have had extensive experience using in previous trials. These will be used on a regualr basis throughout the intervention to monitor intervention delivery. Additionally, the recipients of the intervention, school canteen managers, will complete a survey post-intervention that will be used to assess delivery and receipt of the implementation support strategies, identify any contamination in control schools as well as canteen manager acceptability of such support.
There is some evidence regarding the association of fidelity with school level outcomes, through previous RCTs our research team have conducted in this setting involving various levels of implmentation support delivered (high, medium, low) and comparison of the level of dose of an intervention schools' have received and compliance with the policy.

2. Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?
As the schools that will be included in this study will be from a large geographic location, there will likely need to be adaptations made to the delivery of some of the intervention strategies. For example, we will run training workshops across the region for canteen managers, however some canteen managers are likely to be located too far to attend or unable to attend due to other committments. The delivery of the workshop content will therefore have to be modified, potentially via video link-up or telephone/posting of content and resources. A further likely adaptation will be the level of support provided to canteen managers. It is expected some canteen managers will request more support than others and make contact with the project staff more frequently with queries, therefore the level of support defined in the study protocol realistically my vary from school to school. As the research team has conducted similar implementation support trials in the school setting, we are likely to be able to pre-empt potential adaptations along the way.
In terms of adaptation of the healthy canteen policy, there is some flexibility in how schools achieve this in that they choose what foods and beverages they include on canteen menus, as long as those items meet the policy criteria. We provide canteen managers with many resources to facilitate this and provide different options. Additionally, when schools choose to make healthy changes to their menus is likely to vary as some schools will wait until a change in season or school term to do that, hence the intervention is designed to run across a full school year to allow the time needed for these differences.

In Australia, one in four children under 18 years of age are overweight or obese with prevalence highest amongst adolescents, reaching 28% of 12-15 year olds and 33% of 16-17 year olds. Excess body weight in adolescents tends to track into adulthood increasing the risk of a range of chronic physical and psychosocial health conditions. Poor dietary habits, in particular added sugars, are amongst the key drivers of excessive weight gain in adolescents. Studies have shown that sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) such as soft drinks, energy drinks and sports drinks tend to be the primary source of added sugar in adolescent diets. Consistent with SSB intake reported in other developed countries, a recent 2012 national survey of Australian adolescents indicate SSB consumption peaks in 14-18 year olds, with 51% males and 38% females in this age group consuming SSB the day prior to the survey. Similarly, nearly a third of adolescents in New South Wales, Australia consume two to six cups of soft drink per week contributing between 52g and 156g of added sugar a week.<br /><br />Evidence-based practice, program, intervention or guideline:<br />Recent reviews and trials suggest that improving the relative availability of healthy foods and beverages, particularly in schools, is effective in reducing the prevalence of child overweight and obesity and/or its behavioural determinants. Schools are recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a critical setting to improve public health nutrition and to reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain in childhood. A number of trials utilising a multi-strategic approach, using the Theoretical Domains Framework to map barriers to intervention strategies, have been effective in improving healthy canteen policy implementation in primary schools. Effectiveness of these interventions has also been measured through student purchasing behaviour resulting in a significant decrease in total fat and improvements in total energy and sodium intake from purchases. Whilst there is a growing evidence base of effective strategies to improve the adoption of healthy canteen policies in Australian primary schools, little is known on the acceptability or effectiveness of these strategies in Australian secondary schools. Additionally, whilst studies have reported barriers to implementation of a healthy canteen policy in Australian primary schools, little evidence is available on the barriers secondary schools face when implementing such a policy. A pilot trial conducted by the research team is currently assessing school Principal and canteen staff perceptions of barriers to policy implementation and acceptability of implementation support.<br /><br />Dissemination or implementation gap:<br />Whilst many countries have introduced school based healthy eating policies aimed at increasing the availability of healthier foods and beverages and restricting the availability of less healthy items, research indicates that adherence to such policies is limited. For example, a recent review (2016) of the adoption of healthy school food policies in Australian schools found that adherence with state-wide policies was low.  Research focusing on the implementation of school healthy eating policies in primary schools, has identified lack of executive support, concerns over profitability, lack of skills and knowledge needed to identify healthier menu items and the complexity of policy guidelines as common barriers to policy implementation. Secondary school canteen staff and principals have identified the difficulty in determining the ‘healthiness’ of canteen items, concerns regarding profitability, lack of resources, lack of support from the wider school community and a lack of demand from students as impeding policy implementation. A recent audit of 53 online secondary school canteen menus in the state of New South Wales, Australia, found none were compliant with the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy and only eight schools had no SSB for sale. Additionally, evidence regarding the effectiveness of school-based interventions to reduce SSB consumption is limited.<br /><br />Specific Aims:<br />Primary Outcome: To assess the effectiveness of ‘performance monitoring and feedback’ versus ‘canteen staff training’ as part of a multi-component intervention in increasing secondary school implementation of the NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy.<br />The study will employ a factorial trial design to primarily test the effectiveness of i) performance monitoring and feedback versus ii) canteen staff training. Both of these strategies have been included collectively in effective multi-strategic interventions in primary schools, however, the role and influence each plays individually in improving policy implementation is unknown. Therefore, schools will be randomly allocated to one of four groups;<br />a) 10 month (4 school terms) implementation intervention including performance monitoring and feedback, gaining executive support, tools and resources and on-going implementation support via text messages/emails.<br />b) 10 month (4 school terms) implementation intervention including canteen staff training, gaining executive support, tools and resources and on-going implementation support via text messages/emails.<br />c) A combination of all strategies from groups a and b.<br />d) Control group <br />Data will be collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention and 12 months post-intervention. The effectiveness of the intervention will be determined by comparing differences between groups in the proportion of schools compliant with the NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy via canteen menu audits. <br /><br />Secondary Outcomes: a) To assess the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention in decreasing the intake of SSB by secondary school students located in the state of NSW, Australia.<br />Data will be collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention and 12 months post-intervention. The effectiveness of the intervention will be determined by comparing differences between groups in student self-report SSB consumption via an online survey.<br />b) To assess &#039;Implementation Outcomes&#039; such as acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity and penetration via a telephone survey with school Principals and canteen staff.<br />The RE-AIM evaluation model will be used to guide the trial outcomes and ensure a comprehensive evaluation process. <br /><br />Importance to field:<br />The increase in SSB consumption in children, particularly in adolescents, presents a problem of increasing priority, with evidence showing a strong association between SSB consumption and unhealthy weight gain and increased risk of overweight and obesity. Interventions to reduce the consumption of SSB amongst adolescents in particular are urgently needed to reduce the associated health burden. Policies have been introduced within schools restricting the sale of unhealthy foods and beverages such as SSB however implementation of such policies has been limited. As child and adolescence eating behaviours track into adulthood, the public health benefits of healthy eating policies such as those found in schools, will not be realised if implementation does not take place at a population level, across entire jurisdictions. This study will extend the current evidence base on implementation strategies to support school’s successful adoption of healthy eating policies, by providing evidence of effectiveness in secondary schools, who until now have not been the focus of research in this setting.<br /><br />Reilly Assignment #2<br />1. Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?<br /><br />Fidelity of the delivery of the implementation intervention will be measured through project records which our team have had extensive experience using in previous trials. These will be used on a regualr basis throughout the intervention to monitor intervention delivery. Additionally, the recipients of the intervention, school canteen managers, will complete a survey post-intervention that will be used to assess delivery and receipt of the implementation support strategies, identify any contamination in control schools as well as canteen manager acceptability of such support.<br />There is some evidence regarding the association of fidelity with school level outcomes, through previous RCTs our research team have conducted in this setting involving various levels of implmentation support delivered (high, medium, low) and comparison of the level of dose of an intervention schools&#039; have received and compliance with the policy.<br /><br />2. Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?<br />As the schools that will be included in this study will be from a large geographic location, there will likely need to be adaptations made to the delivery of some of the intervention strategies. For example, we will run training workshops across the region for canteen managers, however some canteen managers are likely to be located too far to attend or unable to attend due to other committments. The delivery of the workshop content will therefore have to be modified, potentially via video link-up or telephone/posting of content and resources. A further likely adaptation will be the level of support provided to canteen managers. It is expected some canteen managers will request more support than others and make contact with the project staff more frequently with queries, therefore the level of support defined in the study protocol realistically my vary from school to school. As the research team has conducted similar implementation support trials in the school setting, we are likely to be able to pre-empt potential adaptations along the way.<br />In terms of adaptation of the healthy canteen policy, there is some flexibility in how schools achieve this in that they choose what foods and beverages they include on canteen menus, as long as those items meet the policy criteria. We provide canteen managers with many resources to facilitate this and provide different options. Additionally, when schools choose to make healthy changes to their menus is likely to vary as some schools will wait until a change in season or school term to do that, hence the intervention is designed to run across a full school year to allow the time needed for these differences.";s:6:"parent";N;s:7:"replies";a:2:{i:0;s:32:"a6f6be4123c40cdef0d252412dfb7458";i:1;s:32:"19bbf936fe3f53d8703280d6932cc5ff";}s:4:"show";b:1;s:3:"cid";s:32:"f3b557aa15d29506e83352d5d8c517b2";}s:32:"e8e9a12633c71a8f536e1161167aedae";a:8:{s:4:"user";a:5:{s:2:"id";s:6:"jbrach";s:4:"name";s:14:"Jennifer Brach";s:4:"mail";s:15:"jbrach@pitt.edu";s:7:"address";s:0:"";s:3:"url";s:0:"";}s:4:"date";a:1:{s:7:"created";i:1534970521;}s:3:"raw";s:5961:"Brach - Assignment #1a

Working title: Comparison of the Effectiveness of an In-person Training Approach to an Online Training Approach for On the Move Exercise Instructors

Health Problem:
Older adults fear losing their independence more so than death.  Walking is important for maintaining one’s independence. Walking difficulty, which can be quantified using gait speed, is a common, costly problem in older adults. Gait speed is a strong predictor of poor health outcomes, including death. Also, those who develop walking difficulty have greater healthcare costs ($1,128 more/year) than those who do not have difficulty. Improving gait speed and preventing walking difficulty could have a substantial impact on quality of life, morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. 

Evidence-based Program:
On the Move (OTM) is a group exercise program to improve walking in community-dwelling older adults. Through a PCORI-funded cluster randomized, single-blind intervention trial we compared the effectiveness of OTM to a seated strength, endurance and flexibility program (Usual Care) on walking ability of community-dwelling older adults. At the end of the 12-week intervention, the OTM group had greater improvements than the Usual Care group in our two measures of walking ability: the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) (20.6±57.1 vs 4.1±55.6 m; adjusted difference=16.7±7.4; p=0.0262) and gait speed (0.05±0.13 vs -0.01±0.11 m/s; adjusted difference=0.05±0.02; p=0.0008). In addition to greater improvements in mobility, our preliminary data indicate fewer falls, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations in OTM vs Usual Care groups. Our findings indicate that OTM is an effective exercise program to improve mobility and health in community-dwelling older adults.

Implementation Gap:
Title III-D of the Older Americans Act provides funding for programs to support healthy lifestyles and promote healthy behaviors for older adults. The federal congressional appropriations law recently included a requirement, stipulating that Title III-D funding could only support programs that meet the highest-level criteria for evidence-based status. Many senior community centers that utilize Title III-D funds for their programming are searching for evidence-based programs to offer to their members. The National Council on Aging (NCOA) reviews applications and determines if programs qualify for evidence-based designation.  In February 2018, we were notified by NCOA that the OTM program was designated as an evidence-based program and will be included in the pre‐approved list for future Title IIID funding from the Administration for Community Living. 

As part of the evidence-based program application, we proposed a comprehensive 12-hour course to train OTM instructors. The cost associated with the training could potentially be a barrier to implementation.  An alternative, less burdensome and lower cost training option would likely be attractive to some individuals and could potentially facilitate implementation.  However, the amount of training required to maintain intervention fidelity and obtain optimal outcomes is unknown. Now that we have shown that OTM taught by research healthcare professionals is effective at improving mobility (i.e. gait speed and 6MWT) in community-dwelling older adults, the next key step is to determine the best way to train non-research healthcare professionals to deliver OTM.  Therefore, our primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of an in-person training approach to an online training approach for healthcare professionals who will deliver the OTM program in senior community centers in Western Pennsylvania. Effectiveness of the training will be determined by examining instructor knowledge and satisfaction, treatment fidelity, and participant-level outcomes of the program.

Specific Aims:
	In this clinical trial, we will randomly assign 30 healthcare professionals to either in-person or online OTM training. Once trained, these individuals will deliver the OTM program twice a week for 12 weeks in a senior community center. Our specific aims are:
1)	To determine if a 12-hour in-person OTM training approach leads to greater implementation success compared to a less intense on-line OTM training approach.
a.	Compare instructor knowledge and satisfaction prior to and after the two different modes of OTM training.
b.	Compare treatment fidelity between classes instructed by individuals trained in-person versus online.  Metrics will include measures of adherence to the intervention protocol (inclusion of essential components), dose of exposure (frequency and duration of exercise classes, adherence and attendance of participants), and quality/competence of the delivery of the program (skill in which the instructor delivers the program).
c.	Compare effectiveness of the OTM program on participant-level outcomes between participants in classes taught by instructors trained in-person versus online. Primary outcomes will be gait speed and self-reported physical function. Secondary outcomes will include measures of health and well-being (e.g., fatigue, sleep) and participant satisfaction. 

2)	To explore instructor-, participant- and center-level factor variation in the above metrics. Factors will include instructor characteristics (such as years of experience and level of education/training), participant demographics (age, race, education level), and community center characteristics (urban/rural, socioeconomic status of the community). 

Importance to field:
Through this trial we will identify the best way to train OTM instructors to maintain treatment fidelity and optimize participant outcomes.  This is an essential step in the intervention development process and is critical as we progress toward our long-term goal to disseminate and implement OTM nationally.

Working Title: Comparing the implementation of weight loss programs in under-served populations  

Background and Significance: 
At least 50% of deaths in the United States are preventable1 with the majority related to behaviors and the social environment.2  Lack of physical activity and poor nutrition may soon overtake tobacco use as the leading causes of death, morbidity and cost as rates of smoking decline and obesity increase. Obesity causes or exacerbates most chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer and musculoskeletal conditions, and results in poorer outcomes of infectious disease.  Racial and ethnic disparities have substantially increased in recent years. In addition, rural populations experience additional burden from chronic diseases due to poor nutrition and lack of physical activity. Therefore it is of utmost importance to study effective interventions to improve physical activity and dietary behaviors among those most at risk, and to explore causal motivational and behavioral mechanisms. 

Evidence-based practice, program, intervention or guideline
The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is a proven, cost-effective strategy to prevent pre-diabetics from progressing to diabetes.  It has been found to be effective among many populations, lowering the risk of progression to diabetes by almost 60%, by increasing physical activity to 150 minutes per week and improving nutrition to sustain an average 7% weight loss among participants.  However, it has not been broadly translated to clinical or community settings, nor have the underlying mechanisms of the behavior change been defined (2-4).  We have developed a CDC compliant program, enriched by use of Self Determination Theory as a guiding theoretical framework, and a training and support program for non-professional community members to deliver the program.  

The Healthy Living Program (HLP), developed through a community participatory approach, includes 45 minutes of physical activity and 45 minutes of an interactive health promotion curriculum adapted from the evidence-based Stanford program (5,6), conducted twice a week in community settings.  The program has been ongoing in the Rochester community since 2001 and has had over 1,700 participants in both the original program targeting African Americans and the revised program, Vida en Salud, for the Latino community (7).  It too can be, and has been, delivered by non-professionals. In under-resourced communities, the HLP has the benefit of training participants to increase physical activity without access to special equipment.

Preliminary study: (HLP vs DPP (Rochester CTSA UL1TR000042, NCATS/NIH) We conducted a pilot study to obtain preliminary data on the comparative effectiveness of the HLP and the DPP on changes in weight, physical activity, and diet and to test the feasibility of recruitment and randomization of low income adults with prediabetes in primary care offices.  Of the total (n=1,215) assessed for eligibility, 7% (n=92) were randomized, 58 completed the baseline assessment, 31 completed the program (13 HLP, 18 DPP).  Physical activity increased more in the HLP (by 226 minutes/week) than the DPP group (by 145 minutes/week). Dietary changes and weight loss were similar in both groups.  Process evaluation identified many areas for improvement to be implemented in the current proposal including: expansion of inclusion criteria, reduction of exclusion criteria, changing the venue to community settings, the use of a cluster rather than individual randomization scheme, and use of a variety of recruitment/enrollment approaches.

Dissemination or implementation gap 
Although the USPSTF recommends intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions for the treatment of obesity, and the DPP has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of diabetes among those who are prediabetic, few obese or pre-diabetic patients are given specific referrals or offered options for weight loss.  In addition, although there have been some implementation studies and efforts to disseminate the DPP, there are many gaps in knowledge regarding the motivational mechanisms of the the program and the best ways to implement it within and outside the health care system.  Currently, payment for such programs is limited to a newly initiated Medicare benefit for the DPP.  It is unlikely that medical practices will be able to implement the current complex Medicare requirements and our experience indicates that participants are more enthusiastic about programs delivered in community settings, where they naturally gather and feel most comfortable, and that are delivered by members of their community.  Given the degree of concern regarding diabetes in the African American community, efforts to make the DPP and similar programs widely available are needed.  While the DPP has been shown to decrease the risk of diabetes and to result in modest weight loss, the HLP shows promise by including physical activity in the curriculum, potentially particularly important in under-resourced, inner city communities where resources for physical activity are limited by lack of access to facilities, safety and weather.   

Both of these programs are resource-intensive and relatively expensive when delivered by professional dietitians or exercise physiologists.  We have explored the use of volunteer community members to deliver both programs in community settings in which they are natural leaders, e.g., churches and community centers.  We provide standardized training and oversight for lay health workers to deliver these interventions.  

Specific Aims 
1)	Compare the effectiveness of two community interventions (the HLP and the DPP) delivered by community members in community settings to improve dietary behaviors, increase physical activity and produce weight loss.  We will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial with mixed methods including a cluster randomized trial with qualitative assessments by recruiting ten community sites (2 programs each) in the Rochester region (inner city and rural) serving a variety of populations ranging from inner-city, under-resourced groups to rural, more isolated populations. We will recruit 400 total participants, or 40 participants (20 for each program) from each of the ten sites.  Randomization will occur at the level of the site to either the DPP or the HLP.  There will be two programs at each site over a year-long period and each will be randomized to be either the DPP or the HLP.  
2)	Assess the extent to which patient outcomes from Aim 1 are predicted by a patient-centered conceptual model of behavior change (Self-Determination Theory), specifically by measuring patient autonomy, perceived competence and needs support.  We will also compare the impact of the programs on adoption and acceptability, motivation (autonomy and competence), satisfaction and sustainability of behavior changes.
3)	Assess the group leaders’ fidelity to the curricula, satisfaction with group leadership, motivation, and ability to sustain their volunteer roles.  The program coordinators will be centrally trained using our existing training program.  Fidelity will be assessed on a regular basis through observation by trained dietitians.  In addition, coordinators will participate in bi-weekly supervision by teleconference.
4)	Conduct a mixed methods process evaluation guided by the RE-AIM framework to gather perspectives of patients, community members and other stakeholders to evaluate the barriers and challenges to implementation, as well as the satisfaction and feasibility of the intervention.  

Importance to field
Americans are spending billions of dollars on ineffective weight loss methods.  It is critical to define the best approaches to improving diet and increasing physical activity among populations with limited access to resources and self-pay programs.  While the DPP is an evidence based intervention, its implementation may need to be adapted to specific settings and populations.  The addition of specific training in physical activity may be helpful to populations with limited access to venues and opportunities for physical activity.  Grass roots approaches to its implementation have the potential to make its benefits available to all.

While the DPP has been shown to decrease the risk of diabetes and to result in modest weight loss, the HLP shows promise by including physical activity in the curriculum, potentially particularly important in under-resourced, inner city communities where resources for physical activity are limited by lack of access to facilities, safety and weather.   <br /><br />Both of these programs are resource-intensive and relatively expensive when delivered by professional dietitians or exercise physiologists.  We have explored the use of volunteer community members to deliver both programs in community settings in which they are natural leaders, e.g., churches and community centers.  We provide standardized training and oversight for lay health workers to deliver these interventions.  <br /><br />Specific Aims <br />1)	Compare the effectiveness of two community interventions (the HLP and the DPP) delivered by community members in community settings to improve dietary behaviors, increase physical activity and produce weight loss.  We will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial with mixed methods including a cluster randomized trial with qualitative assessments by recruiting ten community sites (2 programs each) in the Rochester region (inner city and rural) serving a variety of populations ranging from inner-city, under-resourced groups to rural, more isolated populations. We will recruit 400 total participants, or 40 participants (20 for each program) from each of the ten sites.  Randomization will occur at the level of the site to either the DPP or the HLP.  There will be two programs at each site over a year-long period and each will be randomized to be either the DPP or the HLP.  <br />2)	Assess the extent to which patient outcomes from Aim 1 are predicted by a patient-centered conceptual model of behavior change (Self-Determination Theory), specifically by measuring patient autonomy, perceived competence and needs support.  We will also compare the impact of the programs on adoption and acceptability, motivation (autonomy and competence), satisfaction and sustainability of behavior changes.<br />3)	Assess the group leaders’ fidelity to the curricula, satisfaction with group leadership, motivation, and ability to sustain their volunteer roles.  The program coordinators will be centrally trained using our existing training program.  Fidelity will be assessed on a regular basis through observation by trained dietitians.  In addition, coordinators will participate in bi-weekly supervision by teleconference.<br />4)	Conduct a mixed methods process evaluation guided by the RE-AIM framework to gather perspectives of patients, community members and other stakeholders to evaluate the barriers and challenges to implementation, as well as the satisfaction and feasibility of the intervention.  <br /><br />Importance to field<br />Americans are spending billions of dollars on ineffective weight loss methods.  It is critical to define the best approaches to improving diet and increasing physical activity among populations with limited access to resources and self-pay programs.  While the DPP is an evidence based intervention, its implementation may need to be adapted to specific settings and populations.  The addition of specific training in physical activity may be helpful to populations with limited access to venues and opportunities for physical activity.  Grass roots approaches to its implementation have the potential to make its benefits available to all.";s:6:"parent";N;s:7:"replies";a:1:{i:0;s:32:"faea9c68e614e5c4f099e6dfb0dd978b";}s:4:"show";b:1;s:3:"cid";s:32:"8be7494abff4ca683b7ec1c38e35e584";}s:32:"4a9740858691d660a4e19b28839dce6d";a:8:{s:4:"user";a:5:{s:2:"id";s:10:"mrosenthal";s:4:"name";s:16:"Meagen Rosenthal";s:4:"mail";s:20:"mmrosent@olemiss.edu";s:7:"address";s:0:"";s:3:"url";s:0:"";}s:4:"date";a:1:{s:7:"created";i:1535046975;}s:3:"raw";s:7367:"Rosenthal - Assignment #1a. Specific Aims

1.	Draft a specific aims page (2 pages maximum) of your proposed study. Consistent with most well-written D&I-focused specific aims pages, it should generally address the following 5 elements (and questions). 

2.	My response to this is… 

Health Problem
Most recent estimates suggest that 30.3 million people living in the United States (US) are diagnosed with diabetes. These estimates also suggest that up to 7.2 million people have currently undiagnosed diabetes, and another 84.1 million people are at risk of Type 2 diabetes, determining more effective approaches to helping people manage this condition is imperative. Systematic reviews have shown improved clinical, psychosocial, knowledge, self-efficacy, diet, and exercise outcomes for patients who receive diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES). However, patients may lack access to DSMES, as fewer than 5% of Medicare beneficiaries utilize their benefits, and ongoing education and “top ups” are needed annually, when complications occur, and during transitions of care. As such, the current challenge is to improve patients’ access to DSMES, while also ensuring that education is focused on the specific needs of individual patients.

Evidence-based practice, program, intervention or guidelines
Patient decision aids (PDAs) have been shown to increase patients’ knowledge of their conditions and improve patient expectations of consultations with clinicians. Furthermore, reviews of electronic decision support and management tools for patients with diabetes have demonstrated value and that patients can engage with them independently, a feature that makes them a viable option for integration into the community pharmacy setting. In an effort to improve patient access to DSMES training and overcome some of the community pharmacy specific barriers to the implementation of such clinical services, our team has proposed the development of a patient decision aid (PDA). In particular, this PDA will help patients with Type 2 diabetes identify and prioritize patient-specific DSMES needs that can then be integrated into existing patient counseling mechanisms in the community pharmacy setting. 

Dissemination or implementation gap
Community pharmacists are widely regarded as being among the most trustworthy, and accessible, health care professionals. A recent report from North Carolina revealed that high-risk Medicaid patients visited community pharmacies 35 times in 2013, compared to only 3.5 visits to other primary healthcare providers. Pharmacists have also established a track record for successfully assisting patients in diabetes management. Unfortunately, these services have yet to be completely integrated into normal pharmacy operations due to issues like lack of time and support, and a failure to make modifications to traditional dispensing work-flow processes. Moreover, previous change efforts have not adequately account for how to successfully enact the change process. The purpose of this proposal will be to compare two implementation strategies that have previously demonstrated promise in community pharmacies settings to determine the most effective approach to scale up and spread the use of the DSMES PDA. 


Specific aims (2-3)
The aim of this proposed project will be to expand the use of the developed DSMES PDA in independent community pharmacies in Mississippi by comparing two implementation science strategies. 
To accomplish this aim, a randomized trial, wherein the unit of randomization is community pharmacies will be conducted. Twenty community pharmacies from Mississippi, who are members of the Mississippi Community Pharmacists’ Enhanced Services Network, will be enrolled into the study. Eligible patients will be any patient who has type 2 diabetes. 
The intervention will be either the implementation of the PARIHS framework or the PDSA cycle to facilitate the integration of the DSMES PDA. Each pharmacy will elect one pharmacy team member to complete either i-PARHIS framework or PDSA cycle training, along with the pharmacy manager/owner, develop a plan for the integration of the DSMES PDA based on the training, and implement that plan. The training will provide an overview of each implementation approach, as well as practical instructions for how it could be used in the implementation of the DSMES PDA. The i-PARHIS training will be adapted from the material provided in Harvey and Kitson’s re-imaging of the framework. The PDSA trainings will be adapted from material provided by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Training will involve online and in person components and be delivered in both group and one-on-one settings as required by the individual pharmacy.

Procedures – The study will take place over 2 years. In year 1 the pharmacies’ elected team members and pharmacy manager/owners will undertake the requisite implementation training, develop a plan for implementing the DSMES PDA based on their respective implementation training, and begin the implementation process. It is anticipated that the training and plan development will take roughly 6 months to complete. Allowing for an additional 6 months to fully implement the DSMES PDA. Implementation and patient outcomes data will be collected monthly during this time. In year two observations will continue for an additional 12 months to determine the sustainability of the interventions. Patient outcomes will also continue to be collected. Data collection during year 2 will take place every four months.

Outcome measures – Implementation outcomes will include appropriateness, fidelity, implementation costs, and sustainability. Appropriateness and fidelity will be measured using qualitative interviews to establish issues like perceived fit and adherence. Implementation costs and sustainability will be measured using a survey to pharmacy managers asking for time and resource estimates. Patient outcomes will include changes in the scores of the self-efficacy for diabetes measure, the knowledge and behaviour measures of the DSMES PDA, HbA1c, weight, blood pressure, and patient satisfaction.

Analysis – Appropriateness and fidelity will be analyzed using qualitative content analysis, while implementation costs and sustainability will be analyzed using independent samples t-test. The patient outcome measures (scores of the self-efficacy for diabetes measure, the knowledge and behaviour measures of the DSMES PDA, HbA1c, weight, blood pressure, and patient satisfaction) will also be measured using independent samples t-test. 

Importance to field
To date the pharmacy practice research literature has primarily focused on generating knowledge related to the benefit of pharmacists’ direct interventions in patients care. Furthermore, this knowledge has often been generated in rarified academic settings that are unlike average community settings. Consequently, much less attention has been paid to how to get that evidence into community pharmacy practice sustainably, and how any best practices identified could then be scaled up to multiple settings. The results of this proposed study will provide insight into which implementation framework was most effective in integrating a DSMES PDA into community pharmacies.

1. Draft a specific aims page (2 pages maximum) of your proposed study. Consistent with most well-written D&I-focused specific aims pages, it should generally address the following 5 elements (and questions). 
My response to this is:
Poor mental health is an ongoing problem in the United States and is exacerbated in disadvantaged and vulnerable communities with a long history of community and individual forms of trauma. National data shows adults living in poverty are more than twice as likely to experience serious mental illness (SMI), and these illnesses increase the chances of living in poverty. Persistent exposure to complex traumatic events weakens community resilience to support individual and community recovery and growth after experiencing such traumatic events. Mental health services and treatment are generally provided by a system of clinical providers with some degree of specialized to address clients with mental illness, and prevention initiatives often stem from public health advocacy work centered on addressing social determinants of mental health and mental health service access. In vulnerable communities, the emphasis on mental health and wellness extends beyond agencies and health professionals and into the community-based organizations (CBOs) that interface with residents at high risk of poor mental health. Because such CBOs may have missions centered on other aspects of wellness, they may focus their financial and human resources on the provision of services that support their mission rather than ongoing training to address mental health promotion and recognition of behaviors that warrant clinical mental health services. 
In Flint, MI, there is a nearly 30-year history of economic deprivation, high levels of interpersonal and community violence, declining educational and housing quality, and high levels of chronic physical and psychological health problems among residents. State government decisions yielded a financially-fueled change in the municipal water source in April 2014, and the water source was again changed in late 2014 as health and government officials formally acknowledged resident complaints of poor water quality and declining health associated with the water switch. Poor water quality control resulted in corrosion of the city’s water distribution system. The trauma of this event was complex, amplifying hopelessness among Flint residents and exacerbating the already-high risks of chronic psychological and physical health problems, To date, many Flint residents are still told to use filters for their tap water sources, believe their water is still unsafe, and have limited trust in elected government officials that govern the state and local resources to support access to clean, safe, and trusted water.
The persistently higher prevalence of mental illness in vulnerable communities highlight an ongoing need to new and complementary strategies to fill gaps In knowledge, use, and adoptions of practices that serve to promote mental health in vulnerable communities. In Flint, Michigan, CBOs and clinical partners recognized the limited reach of clinical mental health services in isolation and worked with federal and state health agencies to adopt trauma-informed approaches and principles to support mental health prevention and treatment for Flint area residents. CBOs, community residents, and professionals from non-health sectors have taken interest to address mental health in response to the new and historic traumatic experiences of Flint residents associated with the psychological and physical stressors caused and exacerbated by the Flint Water Crisis. 
We use trauma-informed and evidence-informed approaches to enhance resident and organizational resiliency and capacity to respond to many of the stressors outlined above. As defined by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), “A program, organization, or system that is trauma-informed (1) Realizes the widespread impact of trauma and understands potential paths for recovery; (2)  Recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, staff, and others involved with the system; (3) Responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices; and (4) Seeks to actively resist re-traumatization." The Flint Resiliency in Communities After Stress and Trauma (ReCAST) Pugh (co-PD) and Johnson-Lawrence (co-PD), has fostered interest and awareness of trauma-informed approaches in clinical and non-clinical spaces in Flint, and since January 2017 the ReCAST has provided awareness training and training to use a set of evidence-informed practical skills from the Community Resiliency Model to enable non-clinical community members to support mental health among Flint area residents in complement to available mental health services. Clinical providers are most likely to receive adequately structured training to support their adoption of trauma-informed practices as they provide services. Community residents and staff of CBOs are less likely than clinicians to receive training in the significance and strategies for integrating trauma-informed principles into their organizations, leaving them poorly prepared to provide useful mental health promotion and support their consumers in seeking the appropriate mental health treatment and services and leaving this population to have the same or poorer mental health prognosis.
This proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of an existing trauma-informed, evidence-informed, and community-based mental health promotion program for improving mental health among Flint residents, and evaluate the utility of this trauma-informed program knowledge for use within non-clinical community-based organization settings in Flint, MI. The Community Resiliency Model program has an evidence-informed base, but the appropriateness of this model for a majority-minority community experiencing an ongoing trauma has not been rigorously evaluated, and effective ways to implement these practices in community-based organizations and agencies that are not health-oriented but serve traumatized adults need to be addressed. Basic program evaluations showed that community-based clinical and non-clinical participants (n~200) found the skills easy to understand, applicable to their experiences, and simple to share with others.  The reception of these practices and sharing within social networks for individuals managing persistent stress also needs to be understood. 
The purpose of this work is to evaluate how to expand the use of the Community Resiliency Model for mental health promotion through stress management for adults in the Flint community. The research question is: “Does the Community Resiliency Model promote behavioral health and stress management for adults in the Flint community as they cope with ongoing community trauma?” 
The specific aims are Aim 1: Use a community-partnered approach to assess the feasibility of adults affiliated with community-based organizations use of the trauma-informed approaches, and specifically the CRM, in Flint as measured by the RE-AIM framework. Aim 2: Using a randomized trial design, compare improvements in stress, coping, self-care practices and SF-12 measures for 60 adults across 3 conditions. We will have 20 participants randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) traditional weekly emotional health social support group, (2) 6-hour CRM training with 1-hour follow-up group sessions at 30, 60, and 90 days after completing the training, and (3) 2-hour CRM trainings over a 2-week period, with 1-hour follow-up group sessions at 30, 60, and 90 days after completing the training. The training sessions will emphasize service to others, informed decision making, and self-care. Aim 3: Conduct one focus group with 10 adults from the study outlined in Aim 2 to address social networks through which CRM should be disseminated. This is a small-scale version of the implementation project I would pursue with in a proposal for federal funding.
The proposed study is critical in behavioral health and health equity research because the communities that are most disadvantaged need access to evidence-based programming that destigmatizes mental illness as weakness and provides non-clinical community members with practical skills that acknowledges their reach, increases their capacity adapt the skills for their audience, and empowers them to permanently contribute to mental health promotion in their own communities.

1. Draft a specific aims page (2 pages maximum) of your proposed study. Consistent with most well-written D&I-focused specific aims pages, it should generally address the following 5 elements (and questions). 
My response to this is:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and is largely responsible for African Americans (AA) living 5.5 fewer years than whites. Increased death from CVD is due to high levels of uncontrolled blood pressure among AAs. At 42%, the prevalence of hypertension in AAs is among the highest in the world. Due to heightened prevalence of hypertension, AAs have 1.3 times the rate of nonfatal stroke, 1.5 times the rate of death from heart disease and 4.2 times the rate of end-stage kidney disease as whites.20 Not only are these disparities unjust, they are costly. Mean expenditure per person for the treatment of hypertension is higher for AA ($887) than whites ($679). A key driver of uncontrolled blood pressure in AA is low medication adherence. Causes of low medication adherence include cultural barriers resulting in poor patient-provider communication, patient misperceptions about hypertension and lack of self-management skills. 
Several randomized controlled trials have shown that community health worker (CHW) interventions have been effective at improving blood pressure control among African Americans. By providing culturally relevant education, social support and blood pressure measurement, CHW interventions have improved medication adherence self-management behavior, and appointment-keeping. Most of these interventions have been delivered in a clinical setting. For patients in low resource settings, partnerships with community organizations are recommended in order to reinforce clinical goals.  Self-management of hypertension occurs outside of the clinic and needs to be reinforced there. The church is a trusted institution within the African American community and has been the setting for a number of successful health interventions. A church-based CHW could engage participants in a trusted environment that is regularly frequented by community members. In the church setting a CHW could provide regular and ongoing assistance to improve blood pressure control, with follow-up over time. The level and frequency of contact that would naturally occur in the church setting has the potential to exceed that which is possible in a clinical setting.
To our knowledge, the CHW model has not been utilized to help control blood pressure in the setting of the African American church. The goal of the proposed study is to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) model to test rigorously the effectiveness of a church-based CHW intervention to improve blood pressure control among African Americans in churches in Chicago’s West Side community, a segregated and poor black neighborhood with high rates of chronic disease. A recent surveillance study conducted in seven partner churches (n=1100) found only 21% of adults had measured blood pressure in the normal range (<120/80) and 67% blood pressure ≥ 140/90. We hypothesize that providing a church-based CHW to (1) assist church members to improve medication adherence and effectively communicate with their provider as needed, (2) provide education about lifestyle changes to support blood pressure (DASH diet and physical activity), and (3) link to social services to address other social needs, will result in sustained improvements in blood pressure control in church members. 
Aim 1. Train one CHW from each of 5 partner churches to deliver blood pressure self-management education to 10 church members with measured blood pressure ≥ 140/90 and to link participants with other social services as needed.
Aim 2. Measure effectiveness of church-based CHW intervention at improving blood pressure control over 6 months. 
Aim 3. Analyze impact of church culture, pastor engagement, participant stage of change and other setting characteristics on effectiveness of intervention implementation.

Thank you for sending your aims for your project, which is very interesting.  I have a few questions of clarification that I am sure you can address. I look forward to hearing more about your work next week.

Points of clarification:
•Are the DSME PDAs already developed?  The aims state the following – “In an effort to improve patient access to DSMES training and overcome some of the community pharmacy specific barriers to the implementation of such clinical services, our team has proposed the development of a patient decision aid (PDA). In particular, this PDA will help patients with Type 2 diabetes identify and prioritize patient-specific DSMES needs that can then be integrated into existing patient counseling mechanisms in the community pharmacy setting.” 
•Do you first need to establish that the PDA for DSMEs that will be developed leads to increased use of DSMEs? 
•It would be helpful to devote a portion of the specific aims to describing the i-PARHIS framework and the PDSA cycle, including why it is a good fit for the pharmacy context.
•Also, do these models include a specific focus on sustainability in addition to implementation?
•It sounds like each pharmacy will develop a plan for integrating DSMES PDA.  How will you be able to attribute implementation and sustainability outcomes to either model?  Will there be a standard set of steps each pharmacy will use, based on the implementation model?
•Will you monitor fidelity to the implementation models?

- Your aims (esp. the first one) read a bit more like activities than scientific objectives; start with action verbs like “test” “assess” “evaluate” “identify”
- The low resource angle is very important and might be framed as a health equity issue. To set this up, your intro para and/or significance section could highlight a few key disparities among youth.

There is clear evidence to support the significant need for research developing pragmatic methods to reduce high blood pressure and associate chronic disease in African American populations. Although the use of CHW and faith-based venues such as churches have both demonstrated success in improving health outcomes in the past, the combination of these two methods could be potentially profound. 

It would be helpful to understand a bit more about how this particular project fits into a CBPR framework. Will church members or health workers assist in the development of the project or provide input into the service delivery?

The aims could benefit from greater detail on how this project will be executed. For instance, who will support the CHW outside of grant funding and what, if any sustainment plan will be in place? Have the partner churches already agreed to participate, and how large is the need within these particular settings (and how big is the congregation?). Will the church provide a setting necessary to conduct assessments, or will the CHW engage with the members at the church but then meet them in their homes (as is typical for CHW). 

Aim 3 is particularly interesting and relevant for understanding the characteristics of what contributes to success. This might be difficult to assess with only 5 churches. Is this project proposing a pilot only?

I will be very excited to learn more about this project. This is a great example of community based research and could have a significant impact on a widespread problem.

1.	Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?

Treatment fidelity is a key component of this project and will be measured as an outcome.  We are evaluating two different training modes for the On the Move (OTM) exercise instructors. Our plan is to compare treatment fidelity between classes instructed by individuals trained in-person versus online.  Metrics will include measures of adherence to the intervention protocol (inclusion of essential components), dose of exposure (frequency and duration of exercise classes, adherence and attendance of participants), and quality/competence of the delivery of the program (skill in which the instructor delivers the program). 

Adherence to intervention protocol (inclusion of essential components) – will be measured in two ways.  First, exercise class instructors will be required to keep a log of which exercises they complete in each exercise class.  The instructors will complete a log for each of the 24 classes.  We will review the logs and determine if the essential components (warm-up, walking, stepping patterns, strengthening exercises and cool-down) are included in each of the classes. Secondly, a member of the research team will observe a minimum of three classes (beginning, middle and end) from each set of 24 classes. The researcher will document if the essential components are included in the program.

Dose of exposure will be quantified as the frequency and duration of exercise classes (ideal 2 times per week for 12 weeks, each class 45-50 minutes in duration) and by adherence and attendance of participants.  Each community center is required to document the frequency and time of their programming.  We will obtain this information from the community center. The instructor will keep an attendance log at each class session to measure participant attendance.

Quality/competence of the delivery of the program will be determine through direct observation of the instructor led exercise classes. A member of the research team will observe the instructors teaching exercise sessions.  They will use a standardized checklist to document if the instructor is delivering the program with adequate skill.  The checklist will include items such as appropriately demonstrates exercises, modifies the exercises as needed, progresses exercises appropriately, etc.

We do not have any evidence that associates the level of fidelity with treatment outcomes.  However, we do believe that fidelity of the intervention is key to the success of the program.  In this project we will also be measuring individual level effectiveness outcomes and can look at the association between fidelity and treatment outcomes. 

2.	Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?
The On the Move program was designed so that it should be modified to meet the individual needs of the exercise class. The main content (warm-up. walking patterns, stepping patterns, strengthening, cool-down) should not be modified and other types of exercises should not be substituted. The most likely adaption would be to the program delivery. Currently, OTM is designed to be delivered twice a week for 12 weeks.  I could imagine that some community centers may be unable to offer the class twice a week due to space issues or difficulty finding an instructor.  For the purpose of the current trial I would like to see the program delivered as specified.  If we change too many parameters (i.e. training intensity, program delivery) we will not be able to determine which factors are important to obtaining the desired outcomes. In future studies, I believe the delivery of OTM will need to be modified to meet the needs of the community centers.

Assignment #2:
1.	Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?
We will measure fidelity to the core components of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the Healthy Living Program (HLP) curricula.  Each program has a specific curriculum.  In addition, we assess fidelity to Self-determination Theory (SDT) in the delivery of the interventions.   
One weakness of our current system is the lack of specific fidelity measures.  We will search for such measures for the DPP and incorporate them into our assessments for both programs since the HLP is an adaptation of the DPP.   We will assess fidelity with respect to the following parameters: adherence to the curricula, assessment of dosage ensuring that all sessions are delivered, quality of the delivery of the curricula, engagement of the participants, and program differentiation – ensuring that the participants have learned the critical elements of the curriculum and have changed their behaviors.  Finally, we will track our adaptations (discussed below) to assess their impact.

We conduct these assessments in two ways.
a)	Self-report: of the participants who are asked a series of questions about their satisfaction with the program, knowledge they have gained, their satisfaction with the curriculum, and their sense that their needs were supported by their group leader.  The group leaders participate in weekly supervision sessions with the Program Manager and Clinical Dietician Manager, and reflective-practice groups led by an experienced SDT-trained therapist.  During these meetings, they are able to address specific issues that arise in the content of the curricula and in the group dynamics.  
b)	Observation: Intervention providers or group leaders are intensively trained in the curricula and in the principles of SDT, co-lead a group with an experienced leader, and are then observed leading groups.  In-person observations of group sessions by the Program Manager and Clinical Dietician Manager are then combined with review of audio-taped sessions for ongoing supervision of content and process issues.  Issues related to fidelity are addressed in an ongoing way. 

2.	Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?
The Healthy Living Program (HLP) is essentially an adaptation of the DPP.  It was developed by our community, based on the Stanford program, prior to the adoption of the DPP.  The program was developed through a community participatory process and has been adapted over the years based on new theory (SDT) and knowledge (DPP), effectiveness, feasibility, and for specific populations and venues.  Although it was developed prior to the DPP, the curriculum is very similar and the contact time is the same.  The HLP is an adaptation of the DPP to address: 1) our specific populations – inner city African American and Latino and more recently rural populations; 2) delivery by lay community members; and 3) to fit the local community environment.  The HLP was initially specifically designed for delivery in African American churches and highlighted a faith-based approach.  It has been adapted for delivery in other community settings e.g., public housing, and adapted and translated for the Latino community.  Currently we are adapting the program for rural populations in the Finger Lakes region.  

The key components of the adaptation include: 
1)	Inclusion of physical activity in the curriculum
2)	Shortened program length combined with greater intensity (DPP 1 hour weekly for 16 weeks followed by 8 months follow up; HLP 1.5 hours twice a week for 12 weeks)
3)	Delivery of the program by trained volunteer community members
4)	Focus on culturally tailored dietary recommendations for African American and Latino populations

Given the extent of the HLP adaptations, we do not plan further adaptation during the course of the study.  We will assess the impact of various “natural” adaptations: drop outs from the program, missed sessions, various group dynamics that impact the sessions, barriers to smooth implementation etc.

Fidelity and Adaptation

1.	Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?
2.	Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?

3.	My responses to these questions are… 
a.	Question 1: Fidelity will be measured by self-report using qualitative interviews to establish issues like perceived fit and adherence. Implementation costs and sustainability will be measured using a survey to pharmacy managers asking for time and resource estimates. Patient outcomes will include patient satisfaction measured via a brief survey.

The fidelity interviews with pharmacists will be analyzed using qualitative content analysis, while implementation costs and sustainability will be analyzed using independent samples t-test. The patient satisfaction survey will be measured using independent samples t-test. 

Given the nature of the proposed evidence-based intervention there is not currently evidence connecting the level of fidelity to individual level outcomes. However, the proposed project should provide some initial insights into this question. 

b.	Question 2: Adaptations to the evidence-based intervention will be possible at two levels within the proposed project. First, in the study which develops the DSMES PDA, an evaluation of the utility and acceptability of the instrument will be undertaken. This feedback will be used to adapt the instrument before its application in the currently proposed project. Second, as the instrument is used in this proposed project further adaptations may be considered. 

The proposed instrument is intended to be developed in an online format that is thought to facilitate administration, and will streamline the scoring process. However, depending on the resources available at the community pharmacy level, and the technology knowledge of the patient population it is possible that a paper format for this instrument will be preferable. It is also possible that changes to the design of the instrument will be needed to accommodate the vision needs of the patient population. Finally, it is also possible that the administration route of this instrument may need to be adjusted. It will be designed with the intention of having patients complete the instrument on their own, however, given the varying degrees of literacy levels of the patient population it may be necessary to have someone to help patients complete it. 

During year one of the proposed project, wherein the research team will be working with the community pharmacies to prepare for the roll-out of the DSMES PDA instrument pharmacists will be asked to reflect on the current form of the instrument. From these initial conversations and a consensus building process based on community based participatory research principles the research team members and pharmacists will determine which adaptations will be made. During year two of the proposed project quarterly meetings of the community pharmacists from each of the intervention groups will be provide the opportunity for additional concerns to be raised about the instrument and applying the same consensus process from year 1, additional adaptations may be possible. 

A log of all aspects of the adaptation process will be kept, regardless of whether or not the suggestion actually leads to an adaptation of the instrument. These proposed and actual adaptations will then be mapped against the system of classifying modifications to evidence-based programs developed by Wiltsey-Stirman et al (2013). In so doing we will be able to more accurately track the influence of adaptations against the stated outcomes and more specifically guide the scale-up and spread of the instrument in the future.

Assignment #2
1.	Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?

My response to this is the following:
We will measure fidelity using multiple methods. We will measure adherence, the extent to which an EBI is delivered as intended, using teacher self-report. The measure will include engagement in specific Michigan Model for Health (MMH) content areas as detailed in the curriculum. We will develop a checklist of content areas addressed in the ATOD unit (e.g., short- and long-term effects of drugs, locating drug-related resources for information and services) for the teachers to complete using online reporting. We will also evaluate content areas addressed in related units, including the skills unit (e.g., refusal skills) and social and emotional health  (e.g., getting and giving help). We will assess quality delivery through direct classroom observations by trained research team members. This will include developing an observation protocol and rubric to guide observation scoring. The quality delivery program elements rated on the observation form will be based on National and Michigan Standards of Health Education; this will include activities that address elements such as interpersonal communication, critical thinking and decision-making skills. Finally, we will assess engagement to evaluate student responsiveness to the intervention using administrative data and self-report. This will include data on session attendance, using teacher attendance records, and online surveys to assess student ratings of satisfaction with intervention materials, session activities and information provided.
Researchers have found a mixed results when investigating the relationship between fidelity and individual-level outcomes. Higher levels of fidelity, including adherence, quality and engagement have often been associated with favorable program outcomes, but not in all cases. There exists notable variation in how fidelity is measured and the strength of these associations. 

2.	Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?

My response to this is the following:
We plan on making adaptations to the evidence-based intervention, MMH, to tailor the intervention for students, staff and the school environment in socieconomically disadvantaged communities. We will use the primary components of Replicating Effective Programs (REP), a multicomponent implementation strategy, to guide the adaptations. The three primary components include program packaging, provider training, and facilitation. We will focus on integrating practice-based evidence through end-user (e.g., teachers) input data from mixed method study, the Health Education Experts Study. This study was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and examined factors across domains related to MMH implementation. We will also convene an advisory committee, including teachers and students in the target communities, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) staff and the Regional School Health Coordinator (RSHC: a county-level health education resource for teachers) to inform and refine adaptations. We will first review Health Education Experts study results and propose adaptations based on these results. We will co-develop each REP component, including the manual, training and facilitation. This will include making changes to the existing MMH manual packaging such as adjusting the level of lesson structure, providing lesson options to help meet student needs (e.g., activities to aid students exposed to stress or trauma) and including resources for substance use prevention and treatment suitable for the student population and current trends. We will also update the MMH training protocol. This may include creating a hybrid online-in person training to ameliorate barriers to teachers attending trainings and education on trauma-informed approaches for teachers serving students at high risk of poor health outcomes. Finally, the implementation strategy will also include ongoing facilitation. The RSHC will function as the facilitator and receive specific training in facilitation to support sustainability of the implementation strategy. Facilitation will include regular meetings between the health teachers and RSHC and will address goal-setting, specific implementation guidance, and problem solving barriers unique to the context and student population. We will track all adaptations to the original packaging training and facilitation components. In addition, we will follow up with teachers following program implementation to assess additional classroom-level adaptations through semi-structured interviews.

Brief summary of the health problem, target population, intervention, and aims: 
•	Disparities in smoking prevalence among young adult sexual minority women (SMW) compared with young adult heterosexual women
•	Intervention: Culturally-tailored inoculation messages increase resistance to tobacco industry among young adult SMW
•	This study aims to determine the effectiveness of culturally tailored inoculation messages vs. usual care (non-tailored anti-tobacco messages) in reducing smoking initiation (among non-smokers) and increasing smoking cessation (among smokers) and to assess the potential barriers and facilitators to widespread implementation of this approach to target young adult SMW populations.

1.	Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?

The core components of the theory- and evidence-based inoculation approach, as exemplified by the national Truth campaign, include inoculating the target audience from persuasive tobacco marketing by calling attention to deceptive features of tobacco advertising and the tobacco industry’s practices in order to lower the credibility of the tobacco industry among youth. In this current research, we plan to monitor and evaluate the fidelity to which these components are consistently applied in anti-tobacco communication campaigns to target young adult sexual minority women (SMW). This will be achieved through modes of data collection: 1) implementer organizations’ leaders self-reported assessment of including the core components of the inoculation approach within the communication intervention through key informant interviews, 2) target audience’s self-reported awareness of the tobacco industry’s deceptive marketing tactics to increase tobacco use within the community through surveys with a sample of young adult SMW, and 3) content analysis of all campaign messages utilized by the implementer organizations by the study team to assess the extent that the campaign messages utilize the inoculation approach. To our knowledge, there are no validated fidelity measures for this specific intervention and the study team will develop new measures for this purpose. 

There is insufficient evidence in the literature that level of fidelity to the inoculation approach is associated with individual level outcomes (smoking prevalence among target audiences).   

2.	Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?

Adaptations are expected to be made to the inoculation messaging approach for the intended target population of young adult SMW. The original inoculation messaging approach utilized in the national Truth campaign targeted the general US youth population with messages that expose the tobacco industry’s marketing to youth and tactics the industry used to manipulate youth to try tobacco products. The campaign had utilized mass media to deliver the inoculation messages in the form of broadcast television public service announcements. 

Aspects that would need to be adapted for the current study include the content of the inoculation messages, the context of delivering the inoculation messages, and the level of delivery. First, adaptation to the content of the original Truth campaign messages would include 1) use of culturally tailored symbols, imagery, and language, 2) expose the tobacco industry’s tactics to target LGBTQ consumers (e.g., Project SCUM, sponsoring Pride festivals, promotions and product giveaways in LGBTQ venues such as bars, placing tobacco ads in LGBTQ magazines) 3) messaging to increase resilience against the tobacco industry specific to young adult SMW. Second, the adaptation to the context of delivering the inoculation message would include utilizing trusted health information sources (e.g., peers, community leaders, and healthcare providers) and preferred communication channels (e.g., texting and social media) instead of mass media channels to reach the intended audience of young adult SMW. For instance, based on a Pew Foundation survey, Facebook and Instagram are the most frequently used social media platforms among LGBTQ young adults, suggesting that these would potentially important channels to deliver health promotion messages for young adult SMW. Although there is growing interest in utilizing social media for health promotion (e.g., sexual health) among LGBTQ populations, there is currently limited research on the use of online social media platforms for tobacco-related research and smoking cessation interventions specifically for young adult SMW. Third, the adaptation to the level would involve changing the delivery of the inoculation message from a national level in the original Truth campaign to individual, group, or community-levels for the current study.  

The process to guide adaptations to the inoculation approach for young adult SMW will involve utilizing mixed methods formative research among young adult SMW and potential implementer organizations (e.g., LGBTQ community organization, health center serving LGBTQ patient populations, state or national health agencies) to guide these adaptations to the content, context, and levels of delivering the inoculation messages to the young adult SMW population. For instance, our study team conducted a mixed-methods pilot study in October 2017 to compare young adult SMW’s quantitative and qualitative responses to LGBTQ-targeted imagery obtained from advertising compared to non-LGBTQ-targeted images. Example of LGBTQ-targeted imagery were picture or phrases with implicit (e.g., rainbow flag, ‘out’, or ‘Pride’) or explicit LGBTQ identity (e.g., picture of same-sex male or female couples). These images were obtained from existing consumer advertisements or health campaign messages and were edited to exclude any product or brand information. Participants answered questions on the relevance of images to LGBTQ groups, attitudes toward the image, whether they perceived that they were the target audience, positive (happy, hopeful, inspired) and negative emotions (annoyed, angry, embarrassed). They also provided open-ended comments for each image. Young adult SMW participants reported that ads with LGBTQ cues were relevant for LGBTQ groups; had more favorable attitudes; felt they were part of the target audience; felt more positive emotions (happy, hopeful, inspired) and fewer negative emotions (annoyed) (P<0.05 for all) than non-targeted images. Two themes emerged from the qualitative comments that were consistent with the resilience concept: 1) positive framing of sexual minority identity and 2) social support within the LGBTQ community. These findings will inform the team in adapting the original Truth messages to be culturally tailored for young adult SMW. To determine appropriate adaptation to the contexts and levels of delivery, we plan to conduct focus groups, quantitative message testing among young adult SMW, and key informant interviews with stakeholder organization leaders. 

Adaptation of the specific messages used and message formats (e.g., print, texting, or digital media) is anticipated as the inoculation approach is being delivered because of contextual factors, available resources and capacity across different implementer organizations.

My response to this is:

Core Intervention Components
The intervention is a church-based community health worker (CHW) intervention to improve blood pressure among church members with uncontrolled hypertension. There will be multiple CHWs working across 6 churches. CHWs will have a caseload of approximately 15-20 participants per church. All churches are located in the same geographic area. 

There are two primary intervention components (delivered by the CHW): 1) behavior change counseling using behavioral assessment and action planning, and 2) linking participant to health and social services as needed to address behavioral targets. Behavioral targets are medication adherence, diet, physical activity (PA) and blood pressure self-monitoring. For behavior change counseling, CHW is expected to identify the behavior of focus (adherence, blood pressure self-monitoring, diet or PA) and assess whether the problem is due to logistical issues that can be addressed by social services or advice/support from the CHW (e.g. pill boxes), or motivational issues, that can be addressed by motivational interviewing and/or problem-solving. CHW addresses problem with appropriate strategy and creates action plan with participant. 

Fidelity
We will use Carroll et al.’s (2007) model to assess implementation fidelity, operationalizing fidelity as content and dose of intervention. Content fidelity will be assessed by CHW self-report and observation (audio recording and/or in vivo observation). For self-report, CHW will complete a “visit report” for every contact with participants. This report will include: (a) behavior of focus, (b) assessment of problem (nature of problem and categorization as logistical vs. motivational), (c) intervention strategy (what did CHW do/recommend), and (d) action plan (participant goal). Also, we will monitor social services connected to participant, whether CHW monitored participant follow through and whether participant did actually connect to the social service.

CHWs will also be observed. For a subset of visits a CHW trainer will accompany the CHW to the visit and observe in vivo. For another subset of visits the CHW will record the session. The trainer and/or independent coders (for audio recording) will complete the visit report and judge the appropriateness of the assessment of the problem, the intervention strategy and the action plan. 

Dose will be measured by calculating how many visits were completed (completion means that the visit report is completed) by the CHW during the intervention phase for each enrolled participant. We will also measure the number of supervised field visits completed per CHW.

Following Carroll (2007) we will measure factors that may influence fidelity including: characteristics of the CHW and participant (e.g. education, gender, frequency of church attendance) acceptance of the intervention (e.g. perceived need, usefulness and importance) by participants and church leaders, number of contacts between CHW and back-up support (social worker and clinical supervisor), number of supervised visits with feedback. 

Evidence suggests that greater frequency of field-based mentoring and supervised visits is associated with better outcomes. 

Adaptation
While the CHW will be encouraged to prioritize medication adherence as a behavioral target, he/she will negotiate with the participant about what behaviors to target during each visit. Also, the CHWs will have the option of holding group sessions for multiple participants to provide education and action planning around diet and physical activity. They can do this in partnership with other CHWs across churches or within a single church. Also, CHWs can design strategies to increase church engagement and support for their participants by sharing progress with the pastor and church, and/or having participants give testimony during church about their progress and/or struggles. Because the CHWs are from the church communities and will be working closely with individuals from each church, they will be encouraged to adapt the intervention in the best way they see fit. For each participant, we will monitor whether each core component was modified and why.

My response: My primary ways of evaluating Fidelity will focus on self report from the individual about their practice of the skills and their familiarity with trauma informed approaches, and to assess, from the clients who are receiving services from the providers trained in trauma informed approaches, to evaluate whether they thought their providers were empathetic and at a minimum recommending that they use the skills use the cream skills as part of their regular strategies to cope with stress on a daily basis.

Thanks for your response regarding the use of fidelity and adaptation. A couple of thoughts that you might want to consider. 

First, fidelity is the combination of both adherence (did they do it) and competence (how well did they do it). It is unclear to me how competence is going to be assess from your available fidelity measures. Given that previous research with this model has demonstrated some influence of fidelity, it will be important to understand this relationship and extend it. Fidelity and adaptation very much influence one another. So, for instance, if your previous work suggests that X component is essential to achieve outcomes and it has to be delivered in X fashion to work (i.e., a measure of fidelity) then this is a component that you might want to protect against adaptation (and you also will want to include in your assessment to make sure that it is included). Another important quality of fidelity monitoring is that the goal is to help ensure that services are delivered well and as intended-- thus the use of "chart review" type of assessments is very useful to determine if something was done (and for research data collection), but it does not allow for the feedback loop that we like to see with fidelity monitoring. Will you have a method available to assess in an ongoing fashion, intervention performance, that you then will provide in feedback to the schools so that they can continually strive to improve?  

Second, for adaptation. It is great that you have identified some areas both with implementation and the intervention itself where adaptation might be necessary or helpful. It would be helpful to hear how you plan to operationalize this process and how you plan to measure where and when adaptation occurs, and to what degree. Further, I think it will be important to get an understanding of what actually is an adaptation and what is just more or less intensity of the same thing. For example, you note that some may reach out for more implementation support-- as written this does not sound like an adaptation, rather it sounds like "more" but of the same thing. An adaptation tends to modify a mechanism of action in the intervention or implementation effect. 

As this comes together, I think it would be great if you can define both fidelity and adaptation more precisely and then integrate where you land back into your specific aims. This is going to be really impactful once you get it nailed down! Nice work.

Fidelity: Your plan is excellent, thorough, and well thought-out. I am impressed with your planned use of gold standard observation, in combination with a structured and regular self-report. It will be important for your application to make sure that you describe how rapidly fidelity will be assessed in relation to sessions, how rapidly/frequently feedback from supervisors will be provided, and how this information will be monitored session-to-session to monitor progress over time. I also might suggest that you include a brief version of what you have described within your Aims page (e.g., "fidelity to the CHW model will be assessed via multi-informant assessment including observation, self-report, and audio recording" or something like that). 

Adaptation: It is not clear to me from the way that this is written that a) you are really doing any adaptation and b) that you need to make this a part of your project. You have so much going on that is super important, and adaptation is such a big thing on its own. I wonder if you might consider recommending this first step of your research trajectory to focus on a more discrete and operationalized curriculum or set of protocols that are followed, with perhaps an assessment of where things work and don't work in this community church context. And then from these learnings your next step could be developing an appropriate adaptation in response to what you have learned? Otherwise, if you would like to include adaptation in this stage of your research then I think it will be important to include a few things a) what are the mechanisms of action or the non-negotiables in the CHW work that cannot be adapted? b) how will points for adaptation be identified so that they are considered in a deliberate way? c) how will degree of adaptation be measured so that you can assess the impact? d) if more than one adaptation is included, how will you disentangle the effects so that you know which adaptation was meaningful?

I think this is really exciting study and it has the potential to have a significant impact. I would suggest being clear about what you hope to accomplish with the study, and caution about being too overly ambitious as sometimes this leads to inability to actually measure your effects.

Regarding fidelity--
Utilizing qualitative interviews to establish fidelity is a good way to go, initially.  Having an objective process for assessing fidelity would be useful, too.  Based on your specific aims, these interviews will be conducted with the pharmacists, correct?  Will a goal for this qualitative approach be to develop a standardized approach (e.g., measure or tool) for fidelity monitoring?  Do you see fidelity monitoring as something that should be part of the implementation process, so that information could be used for ongoing monitoring of fidelity – e.g., by the pharmacists or by your team during this research?  Would information on fidelity be used for providing feedback to pharmacists to promote adherence to the implementation plan for DSMES PDA?

Assessment of costs and sustainability are not directly tied to fidelity monitoring but are components of implementation.  Fidelity could certain influence sustainability and possibly costs.

Regarding adaptation--
What is the goal of the process you are proposing to use?  Will you make overall adaptations or adaptations that are specific to a pharmacy setting or patient?  What are the known or likely core components of the DSMES PDA intervention, and how will you ensure that they are retained during the adaptation process?  It’s good that you will plan for comprehensive documentation of adaptations to be able to consider how these modifications may impact implementation and outcomes.

My main questions focus on the adaptation process.  Once I get a better understanding of this aspect of your work, I think it will help to clarify what you have outlined in terms of the fidelity monitoring process.
Regarding adaptation—
Will your adaptation processes result in a set of messages that can be used in your “Inoculation” study, or will it result in a set of available adapted messages that stakeholders can select for implementation in the “Inoculation” study?  
What process will you use to document adaptation “in the field” as stakeholder groups are implementing the messages?

Regarding the adaptation process, the goal is to develop a range of inoculation messages that stakeholders will select from, for implementation within their specific settings. The adaptation process will occur at two levels: 1) the study team will adapt the core components of the inoculation messages from the Truth campaigns to be relevant for young adult SMW through focus groups and quantitative ratings of the adapted messages among SMW and obtaining practice-based expert input from stakeholder organization leaders 2) together with stakeholders, we will adapt the messages for specific formats and platforms during the implementation that is best suited to the contexts of stakeholder organizations (e.g., health center serving LGBTQ patient population, community outreach organization, or tobacco control advocacy organization). 
To document the adaptations in the field, we will assess the following sources of adaptation by by the stakeholder organizations through observations of the delivery of the intervention: 1) what specific inoculation message(s) were used, 2) what surface-level adaptations were made to the messages, 3) what type of setting are the messages being implemented, 4) what specific SMW target audience is served by the organization, and 5) what mode of delivery was used.

My responses to these are;

1.RE-AIM – chosen as it provides a comprehensive evaluation framework at the organisational and individual level. The RE-AIM elements help guide the outcomes and hence influence the strategies chosen to impact these. The RE-AIM elements will help us identify not only policy effectiveness and implementation but whether we have increased the reach of the policy to the target schools, whether we impact on schools’ level of intended adoption of the policy and whether positive changes to policy implementation can be maintained once the intervention ceases.

Diffusion of Innovations - This theory is chosen as it identifies a number of characteristics of an innovation/policy that impact on the rate of adoption by the target population including; the innovation/policy being perceived to have greater advantage over what they are currently doing; it is compatible with how they work; it is of less complexity; it can be easily trialled first; and have visible results. These elements align well with the known barriers to policy implementation which the study aims to address such as complex guidelines, lack of knowledge and skills and perceived lack of support.

2. The RE-AIM domains will define the outcomes and measures of the study; Reach of the policy, Effectiveness of implementation of the policy to decrease SSB consumption, level of Adoption of the policy, policy Implementation and Maintenance of policy implementation over time. Strategies are chosen to support policy implementation and help overcome barriers to implementation.

Intervention and implementation strategies will be mapped to the characteristics of Diffusion of Innovations theory addressing each of the elements that have been identified to impact on rate of adoption, eg. relative advantage (staff training), compatibility (executive support, consensus processes), complexity (staff training, tools and resources), trialability (performance monitoring and feedback), observability (performance monitoring and feedback). 

Possible associations between eg. level of adoption and program acceptability, appropriateness may also be explored.

REILLY - Assignment 3b (Measures and evaluations)
1.	What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
2.	What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
3.	Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not?

My responses to these are;

1. The primary outcome is to assess the effectiveness of ‘performance monitoring and feedback’ versus ‘canteen staff training’ in improving secondary school implementation of a healthy canteen policy. This will be determined by comparing differences between groups in the proportion of schools compliant with the NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy via canteen menu audits at baseline and follow-up.

Secondary outcomes include; i) the effectiveness of the trial at an individual level to decrease the intake of SSB by secondary school students. This will be measured through student self-report SSB consumption via an online survey at baseline and follow-up; ii) reach of the policy through principal and canteen manager knowledge of the policy, measured through surveys at baseline and follow-up; iii) level of adoption of the policy measured at the principal and canteen manager level through surveys at baseline and follow-up; and iv) maintenance of implementation of the policy through menu audits conducted 6-months post intervention completion.

2. We will also assess principal and canteen manager acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility and satisfaction with the intervention through survey questions at follow-up to ensure we are delivering support that is suitable to our end-users. We will measure fidelity of program delivery by project team staff through project records and by canteen managers through completion of tasks and survey questions at follow-up, eg. Did they complete an action plan? Did they attend staff training? Did they provide menus for feedback?

3. A potential unintended consequence of the study could be changes to canteen profit. We are aiming to capture this either through collection of financial data of the canteen from the treasurer or through survey questions to the canteen manager at follow-up. Previously the research team has attempted to collect canteen financials with minimal success so more thought still needs to go into this however as a commonly reported perceived barrier to implementation is loss of profit, we certainly want to capture any of this negative impact.

My responses to these are:

This study (Culturally-Tailored Inoculation Message Approaches to Increase Resistance to Tobacco Marketing Among Young Adult Sexual Minority Women at Multiple Levels of Intervention) is grounded in the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework developed by Aarons et al. (2011). The EPIS framework is most applicable to this proposed study because it captures multi-level influences on the use of research evidence in the public sector across multiple phases of the implementation process, with the long-term objective of achieving sustainment of an evidence-based intervention. 

Specific to this project, the EPIS framework informs the focus of the study on the Exploration, Adoption/Preparation, and Implementation phases of the implementation process. For instance, the Exploration phase prompts attention to consider the contextual factors that could influence the adaptation of the evidence-based inoculation intervention for young adult SMW audiences and factors that will influence the ability of stakeholders at different levels and in different practice settings to prepare, adopt, implement and sustain the intervention over the long term. Important contextual influences in the Exploration phase relevant to this study including: 1) sociopolitical; 2) funding; 3) advocacy efforts for tobacco control among SMW and other relevant groups; 4) inter-organizational networks; 5) organizational characteristics; and 6) characteristics of decision-makers. By gathering contextual data on how stakeholders make decisions about health communication strategies to target SMW to achieve health promotion objectives, we will learn what data will be compelling in helping them make adoption decisions, what adaptations to the intervention will increase the fit with the organization, what resources/constraints influence their ability to use the approach, and maximize sustainment of the intervention in the long-term. 

Assignment #3b - Measures & Evaluations:
1. What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
2. What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
3. Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not? 

My responses to these are:

The primary outcomes are young adult SMW’s intention of smoking initiation (among non-smokers) and smoking cessation (among smokers). These will be measured based on participants’ self-report using previously validated scales (Juster Scale and the Smoking Cessation Contemplation Ladder). The secondary outcome is resistance to tobacco industry marketing, measured based on self-report using scales assessing participants attitudes and beliefs about tobacco companies. The rationale for measuring these outcomes is because the effects of culturally tailored inoculation approaches on smoking and quitting intentions have not been examined among young adult SMW.

The implementation process measures in this study include assessing the contextual influences in the Exploration, Adoption/Preparation, and Implementation phases of the implementation process. For instance, in the Exploration phase, we will explore six areas of interest: 1) sociopolitical context including legislation and policies that broadly impact tobacco-focused health outreach, and opportunities to specifically use inoculation messaging, 2) impact of funding including availability of grants to support tobacco-focused communication interventions, 3) range of advocacy efforts for tobacco control among SMW and other relevant groups and ways in which the health communication evidence base does/does not play a role in this work, 4) inter-organizational networks that may influence utilization of an evidence-based communication strategy broadly and the inoculation strategy specifically, 5) organizational characteristics including culture, climate, leadership, and receptivity to new ways of conducting outreach both in the context of communication innovations and the inoculation strategy, and 6) characteristics of decision-makers and leaders including values, goals, and perceptions regarding the need for change. We will conduct key informant interviews (one-on-one discussions) with Expert Advisory Committee members comprising practitioners within LGBTQ healthcare and community-based settings, LGBTQ advocacy organization leaders, and representatives from national-level health agencies. We will adjust the questions based on the type of key informant. For example, with the California LGBTQ Partnership, we will focus on questions related to the political environment and emerging trends in the area of tobacco legislation and awareness of industry influence on LGBTQ tobacco use. The interview guide will draw on published protocols for qualitative exploration and quantitative measures developed by Aarons et al., grounded in the EPIS framework. The rationale is to identify contextual factors critical to adaptation of the inoculation intervention to maximize the fit of the intervention with the needs of community and public organizations serving SMW and the LGBTQ community and enhance long-term sustainment of the intervention across these sectors.

Potential benefits and unintended consequences—One potential unintended consequence of the intervention implementation is negative reactance against the inoculation messages’ persuasive intent among the target audience of young adult SMW due to threat against personal autonomy. To minimize this risk, we designed a rigorous multi-step process of formative research to design and test culturally tailored anti-smoking messages (i.e., containing LGBTQ-relevant imagery, symbols, and language for young adult SMW) that will involve obtaining critical input from the Expert Advisory Committee members, focus groups with young adult SMW, argument rating and message pretesting, and an online randomized controlled experiment.

However, REP is also informed by Social Cognitive Theory and Diffusion of Innovations, both classic theories to help inform the approach to best disseminating research-based interventions to practitioners. Ongoing facilitation is based on the PARIHS (promoting action on research implementation in health services), a determinant framework. I am using enhanced REP because it has been used in community settings and provides a structured roadmap to guide implementation for community organizations. In addition, the framework fits well within the existing infrastructure to disseminate innovation within schools.

2) How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)?

This framework can help guide selection of implementation outcomes, such as acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness of using a specific implementation strategy. These are important outcomes to assess as this is a novel application of a multicomponent strategy for prevention in schools. Using enhanced REP, because it includes tailoring of each component and involves stakeholders, would influence the process of developing the implementation strategy. End-users and stakeholders participate actively in the planning and implementation of well-informed modifications made to tailor the program for the population and the setting.

Assignment #3b
1) What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

Fidelity: engagement. Engagement has been identified as a fidelity dimension that provides information on participant responsiveness to the intervention and is key to program success. As described by Barrera et al, we will assess engagement using student satisfaction and key program skills. 
i)	Satisfaction: We will adapt a satisfaction measure for students to rate the effectiveness of the teacher’s approach, and in-class activities, based on Reid et al.  
ii)	Key skills: we will assess key program skills as identified by the health curriculum such as assertive communication, refusal skills, and effective listening, Students will rate their level of agreement using a Likert scale on their proficiency with each skill. 

Fidelity: Quality delivery: We will assess quality delivery through direct classroom observations by trained research team members. This will include developing an observation protocol and rubric to guide observation scoring. The quality delivery program elements rated on the observation form will be based on National and Michigan Standards of Health Education. 

Adherence: We will develop a checklist of content areas addressed in the ATOD unit (e.g., short- and long-term effects of substances) for the teachers to complete using online reporting. 

Feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness. Using semi-structured interviews, we will elicit feedback on specific barriers and facilitators to implementation and evaluations of the implementation process. In addition, we will use the measures described by Weiner et al. for the aforementioned constructs. We will also use classroom observations with detailed field notes to evaluate these outcomes.

Youth substance use: Using items from Monitoring the Future (MTF), We will assess past 3- and 12-month marijuana, cigarette and e-cigarettes, alcohol, and binge drinking. We will assess medical and non-medical prescription substance misuse (PDM) using items from the Secondary Student Life Survey.

2)	What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

We will evaluate multiple sub-dimensions of implementation processes as described in the CFIR framework. We will track time and activities associated with pre-implementation planning. We will use the CFIR interview guide (CFIRguide.org) to develop our semi-structured interviews with teachers and other key stakeholders, including questions addressing implementation strategy execution and feedback to refine the implementation strategy for a subsequent iteration. 

3)	Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not?

Assessing unintended consequences may be especially important in low resource contexts. For example, if we integrate calming activities into the program package to meet the needs of students experiencing toxic stress and trauma, this may pose challenges to completing all the lessons. We will assess these potential unintended consequences through semi-structured interviews with questions focused on feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness in addition to quantitative measures of these constructs.";s:5:"xhtml";s:5547:"Eisman- Assignment #3a<br /><br />1) Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?<br /><br />The focus of my proposal is on using the enhanced Replicating Effective Programs framework as an implementation strategy to improve delivery of a school-based substance use prevention program.

1.Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?
Briefly, I am examining two modes of training instructors for an Evidenced-based exercise program called On the Move (OTM). Specifically, I want to determine if a 12-hour in-person OTM training approach leads to greater implementation success compared to a less intense on-line OTM training approach. Secondly, I plan to explore instructor-, participant- and center-level factor variation in the measures of implementation success. The REAIM framework and the CFIR model are most applicable to my proposed study. I used the REAIM framework to guide the evaluation of the implementation program and the selection of outcomes for Aim 1. My overall implementation framework is based on CFIR, in that in Aim 2 I am examining how factors within the outer setting, inner setting and individual characteristics may impact the training of the On the Move instructors and the success of the implementation of the On the Move program. 
2.How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)? 
The REAIM framework provided a structure to identify important outcomes that I needed to consider when determining implementation success. For example, I will be measuring the effectiveness of OTM on participant-level outcomes such as gait speed and participant satisfaction, I will be measuring adoption by the OTM instructors and the senior community centers, and I will be measuring implementation by measuring the quality and fidelity of the program delivery. The CFIR model provided me with a framework to think about or consider all factors that may impact the success of the implementation and how these factors may contribute to the variation in the implementation success.

Assignment #3b - Measures & Evaluations:
1.What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
To determine if a 12-hour in-person OTM training approach leads to greater implementation success compared to a less intense on-line OTM training approach we will measure the following outcomes:
1)	instructor knowledge and satisfaction prior to and after the two different modes of OTM training. Instructor knowledge will be measured using a written test and satisfaction will be obtained through a satisfaction survey.
2)	treatment fidelity will be measured using measures of adherence to the intervention protocol (inclusion of essential components), dose of exposure (frequency and duration of exercise classes, adherence and attendance of participants), and quality/competence of the delivery of the program (skill in which the instructor delivers the program). Fidelity was described in assignment 2.
3)	effectiveness of the OTM program on participant-level will be measured using gait speed and self-reported physical function. Secondary outcomes will include measures of health and well-being (e.g., fatigue, sleep) and participant satisfaction. 
For Aim 2 – we will measure instructor-, participant- and center-level factors which may explain the variation in the above metrics. Factors will include instructor characteristics (such as years of experience and level of education/training), participant demographics (age, race, education level), and community center characteristics (urban/rural, socioeconomic status of the community).

2.What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them? I would be interested in measuring facilitators and barriers to implementing the On the Move program and any adaptions that occur during the implementation process. I believe the best way to measure these items would be through semi-structured surveys and focus groups of both the OTM instructors and the senior center staff.
3.Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? One potential co-benefit would be increased attendance at the senior centers. We could measure this by tracking senior center attendance before and after implementation of the On the Move program.

My responses to these questions are… 

PLEASE NOTE: Since my last submission I found out that the grant I had planned on building off of for this project will not be funded. As such I am in the process of reorienting my project for this program. I still plan on comparing the efficacy of two implementation strategies within the community pharmacy environment. However, the evidence-based practice I will now be using is medication therapy management (MTM), rather than the previously proposed tool. 
	After doing some additional reading I am planning on designing this project to mirror Curran et al. Hybrid Type 2 design, to collect data on both the clinical outcomes of MTM, as well as implementation outcomes from the comparator implementation strategies. MTM has a relatively long history of use in pharmacy, but, it has not been widely adopted and some of the clinical studies have revealed mixed results. I am hypothesizing that one of the underlying reasons for these mixed results is that appropriate consideration of the implementation process in community pharmacy has not been taken. 
	One of the comments that I received from Dr. Brownson during our elevator speech call was that rather than comparing, which after this module I now understand to be models, I actually want to compare implementation strategies. I must admit that this was the first time that I had heard this distinction being made. I located a paper by Leeman et al (2017) from Implementation Science, which provided five classifications for implementation strategies. I have decided to compare the differences between integration strategies to capacity-building strategies. 
I am still working out all of the details and implications of this change. Please forgive me if some of my responses below are disjointed, but I will get all of the details worked out as I progress through the rest of the program. 

1.	Response 3a.#1 - The primary framework for this project will be the promoting action on research implementation in health services (i-PARiHS) framework, and is an extension of the previous PARiHS framework. This framework is comprised of four components: facilitation, innovation, recipients, and context, with facilitation acting as the catalyst to assess, align, and integrate the other components. The previous version of framework has been utilized in a community pharmacy research trial examining how medication management services could be made sustainable. While this framework acknowledges the complexity of the implementation process, much of the previous research applying this framework has been retrospective, and has not clearly detailed how the components were measured, and has been unable to specify how to make the changes once the context and recipients are understood and facilitation is available.
I will also be integrating an off-shoot of the capability, opportunity, motivation (COM-B) system called the behavior change wheel (Michie et al. 2011). This method provides an approach for designing and characterizing behavior change interventions. 
I have chosen to use the i-PARiHS framework because it has been used previously in community pharmacy practice research trials, and its emphasis on the necessity for facilitation to catalyze the change process is appealing based on my knowledge of the context of the community pharmacy environment. The addition of the behavior change wheel will provide tangible measures, as well as providing insights into how changes can be made once the context and recipients have been fully understood. 

2.	Response 3a.#2 – The i-PARiHS framework emphasis on the value of facilitation and obtaining a solid understanding of the context, recipients, and innovation before the implementation of 

3.	Response 3b.#1 – Clinical outcomes to be measured include the change in the number of MTM services provided, changes in patients’ medication profiles based on pharmacists’ suggestions, and when point of care testing equipment is available (ex. blood pressure monitoring) baseline and follow-up measures of blood pressure and blood glucose will also be obtained. The numbers of MTM services and changes in medication profiles will be obtained from pharmacy records through de-identified monthly reports. Data collection forms will be created and used for results from any point of care testing undertaken. 

Implementation outcomes include acceptability of the strategy to pharmacists, technicians, and pharmacy managers, costs of using the respective implementation strategy, and sustainability. I propose to use the Evidence based practice attitude scale to measure acceptability. Costs data will be obtained from the pharmacy manager who will be asked to estimate the number of work hours dedicated to the implementation strategy. Sustainability data will be obtained through an 18 and 24 month check-in with each group of pharmacies (it is still anticipated that the proposed project will run for 12 months) who will be asked to run a report for the number of MTM services provided and changes to drug therapy only the previous 6 months at each time point. At this time, I don’t think it will be feasible to obtain the point of care testing results.
 
4.	Response 3b.#2 – I am still not 100% certain how to measure process. The current plan will be to measure changes in scores on the Barriers and facilitators assessment instrument from baseline to 12 months, in addition to conduct in-depth interviews with one pharmacist, technician, and manager representative from each participating pharmacy. My thought process behind measuring the change in the barrier and facilitator assessment instrument is to see the impact of the respective strategies, using the assumption that if they are successful we will be able to establish differences in each of the constructs. The interviews will provide details on the lived experiences of the respective implementation strategies. 

5.	Response 3b.#3 – I need to think about this question further given the changes I have made to the study design over the last couple of weeks. Could you please provide me with an example of what an unintended consequence of an implementation might be? – Thank you again for your patience as I rework this project.

1. Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?

Implementation theory and evaluation frameworks are most applicable to my proposed study because the purpose of this project is not to redefine this particular intervention, but instead to examine what will determine the adoption, spread, and maintained use in the Flint community post-water crisis. I would like to describe the implementation process and test two implementation strategies. Using implementation theories in this situation can aid in guiding the assessment for readiness to change in the community context. 
The models that are most applicable include community based participatory research, the consolidated framework for implementation research, the RE-AIM framework, Diffusion of Innovations, and the conceptual model of implementation research.

2. How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)?

Because my team has already been working within a program to disseminate the Community Resiliency Model in our study, we have already been following the recommendations of our community partners for sharing this model in the community. These discussions suggest that there are still multiple ways to adopt the content, and specifically that there are many strategies we can use to facilitate implementation of the CRM model. The second model we will use (RE-AIM, CFIR, DoI) will focus on strategies and evaluating the effectiveness of the CRM since it has been used in other contexts with demonstrated reductions in self-reported psychological distress of the persons trained to use these practices. 

The CBPR model has been our general approach to the entire CRM use in Flint. Using our CBPR approach, we have discussed with our community partners at length the various needs for adaption in the content delivery (6 hours may be too long or difficult for professionals and working community members to attend in one setting); context (how the program can be beneficial for community residents dealing with their personal stressors, community residents dealing with their families, community organization staff with regular resident interaction, community organization staff with each other, and human services organizational staff); engagement (we held introductory sessions for evaluating the content and program before it was the permanent adoption); evaluation (participation evaluation has happened with initial sessions, and there is preliminary data being currently collected to evaluate the utility of the program content by the community organization staff using with each other, at least); stakeholders (which in this case, includes the community as a whole who are working to respond to the distress induced by the Flint water crisis, but largely attributable to a history of community trauma); and strategies (deciding where sessions should be taught; whether we do introductory sessions and then ask for follow up sessions; whether we do introductory sessions and then require that getting this means they get the follow ups; spacing the follow up sessions a particular amount of time apart; asking people to practice and providing them with an opportunity to share best practices and barriers; offering monthly workshops that center on practicing 1-2 skills each to support retention of content; including the 6 specific skills within the CRM, and identifying opportunities for practicing the skills before needing the skills in distressing contexts). 

My interest in this proposal is to focus on the reasons that some people remember to use the skills while others may find it more difficult is participate, and the conditions that we should ensure are present to help people understand and practice the skills and to engrain them as an easily recognizable intervention to address self-care, reduce secondary trauma, and support the wellbeing in interpersonal interactions with others.

Assignment #3b - Measures & Evaluations:
1.What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
Health outcomes: perceived stress (Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale), coping, self-care practices (based on recommendations of commumity partners, but including mindful type activities), and SF-12 as a general measure of wellness/self-reported health. I will also use the Connor-Davidson assessment of resiliency. These measures are a reflection of the constructs the CRM is expected to improve. Secondary outcomes are related to relationship development and secondary trauma.
D/I outcomes:  acceptability (we have this in pilot data), adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, penetration, efficiency, effectiveness, equity, timeliness. The interest for this project is to make sure we know how to best get this information into this community, and not have such content restricted to human services professionals.
2.What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
The process we are measuring is about the method of content delivery. We are interested in which form of delivery will best enhance retention and use of the CRM. We will offer the content in 2 different formats, and evaluate acceptability and feasibility of each delivery approach. The program may need to be delivered in different formats for people who are human services professionals who work for large organizations that can afford for the staff to be out, but this may not be the case for participants working in smaller community organizations or who work in non-human services/unrelated professions. 

3.Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not?
We will use our community-partnered approach to evaluate unexpected benefits and consequences through meetings with our stakeholders and previous intervention participants. We will use qualitative methodologies to collect this information.

1.	Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?

The goal of our church-based community health worker (CHW) pilot intervention is to improve self-management behavior among disadvantaged African Americans with uncontrolled hypertension. The intervention targets three behaviors: medication adherence, diet and physical activity. CHWs will work with participants to achieve these behaviors by using behavior change techniques and linking participants to necessary social resources. 

We plan to use the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) in order to understand determinants of these behaviors and select appropriate behavior change techniques for the intervention.
The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) is a framework that integrates multiple theories of behavior change. It consists of categories of behavior change techniques (BCTs) that are organized according to their mechanisms of action (e.g. goals and planning, social support, reward and threat).(1) Underlying the TDF is a theory of behavior called the COM-B, which proposes that behavior is caused by an interaction of capability, opportunity and motivation. The TDF is useful for multiple reasons. First, it encourages consideration of a wide range of potential determinants of behavior and behavior change strategies for intervention design. Second, the COM-B theory of behavior supports hypothesis generation about the theoretical mechanisms underlying the intervention. Third, it provides clear definitions of intervention components which will help clearly define the intervention and support careful measurement of fidelity across CHWs. 

A novel aspect of this intervention is that it takes place within the church setting. A long-term goal of this research is to explore whether embedding CHWs (and/or preventive services more generally) within the trusted setting of the church could enhance the reach and effectiveness of preventive care for vulnerable populations. Therefore, it is critical to understand how dimensions of the church setting impact implementation and effectiveness of the CHW intervention. We will use constructs from the Inner Setting domain of the Consolidated Framework for Intervention Research (CFIR) to inform our exploration of the impact of church–level factors on intervention implementation and effectiveness. We will also use other CFIR constructs (Characteristics of Individuals) to inform an assessment of CHW characteristics which may influence CHW performance, church-wide perceptions of the intervention and also intervention effectiveness. 

2.	How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)?

A key goal of this pilot study is to understand determinants of key behaviors related to blood pressure control in our target population. As stated above, the TDF provides a broad taxonomy of behavioral determinants which we can use to classify causes of behavior in participants. These determinants can also be linked to dimensions of the COM-B theory of behavior to generate hypotheses about the mechanism of behavior change underlying our target behaviors.  Additionally, it provides a framework for selecting and precisely describing intervention components which is useful for measuring implementation outcomes (e.g. fidelity).

Similarly, use of the CFIR will allow us to construct interview and/or survey questions to assess dimensions of the church environment (Inner Setting) as well as CHW characteristics that may impact implementation of the intervention. In turn, this may inform church-wide intervention strategies that may be needed to enhance the effectiveness of the CHW intervention in churches or CHW factors that may moderate intervention effects and could potentially be addressed by modifications to CHW training. 

Assignment #3b - Measures & Evaluations:
1.	What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

Individual-level change in blood pressure. The primary outcome of the study is change in blood pressure from baseline to follow-up. This will be measured by an RA during assessment visits. We are measuring this to determine whether the intervention was successful in reducing this important cardiovascular risk factor. 
	
Individual-level change in target behaviors. We will measure change in three target behaviors (medication adherence, diet and physical activity) in order to understand whether they were impacted by the intervention and whether those changes were the mechanism for any change in blood pressure. We are hoping (depending on cost) to measure change in medication adherence using pill caps because that is the only available objective measure of medication adherence. We will measure change in our four target diet behaviors (SSB consumption, fruits and vegetables, fiber consumption and sodium consumption) using dietary screeners because they are short and practical, albeit less reliable than a diet recall. We may use fast food consumption or home cooking as a proxy for sodium consumption as there are no brief measures of sodium consumption. To assess physical activity, we will measure change in steps using pedometers or accelerometers at baseline and follow up because those are objective measures. We will also measure weight change as a proxy for change in diet and physical activity.

Individual-level change in knowledge. We will use a validated hypertension knowledge test to determine change in knowledge. We hypothesize that a key mechanism by which CHWs will impact blood pressure is by changing knowledge of participants about the consequences of uncontrolled blood pressure and the risk factors for hypertension. Participant change in knowledge can also be used as a measure of CHW effectiveness.

Acceptability, Appropriateness, and Feasibility of intervention (individual-level). We will use the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) (2) to measure intervention acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility of the intervention among individual participants. We will also measure this among CHWs. We will measure this to determine how participants feel about healthcare being provided at their church, as this is not the common setting for preventive care delivery. Also, we will use those scales to assess whether the intervention is perceived as too complicated. 

Number of visits. A key implementation outcome is the number and type (i.e. phone, church, home) of CHW visits completed for each participant (and each CHW). This is important because the number of visits is a simple metric reflecting extent of implementation of the intervention and may be more sensitive to determinants of implementation (i.e. CFIR constructs) than changes in blood pressure, weight or target behaviors.  

Change in barriers to hypertension control. We will use a validated measure to assess change in barriers to blood pressure control pre and post-intervention. 

2.	What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?

(Not sure exactly what “processes” are.)

We will measure the impact of CHW characteristics on intervention implementation and outcomes, as CHWs may vary widely and CHW characteristics are known to impact CHW effectiveness (3). Hypertension knowledge and self-efficacy to help others manage their blood pressure will be assessed using validated scales (where possible). Identification with the church will be assessed as length and extent of involvement with the church. Beliefs about the effectiveness and appropriateness of the intervention will be assessed in a qualitative interview. Participants will also be asked to rate their CHW on dimensions such as timeliness, supportiveness, helpfulness, and follow up. 

The following CFIR Inner Setting dimensions will be assessed in qualitative interviews with CHWs, church leaders (especially the pastor) and/or participants: Implementation climate (the extent to which the CHW intervention is rewarded, supported and expected by church leadership), perceived  compatibility of the intervention with church values, tension for change (urgency of the problem of uncontrolled blood pressure), relative priority (importance of this problem in relation to other problems, such as youth violence) and leadership engagement. This qualitative study will be conducted in order to assess which aspects of the church environment might impact intervention implementation and the mechanisms of that influence. Findings may be used to create quantitative measures for use in future studies.

3.	Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not?
Part of the reason for the qualitative interview described above is to identify any unintended consequences of the implementation.

Assignment #3a - Models:
1.	Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?
Self Determination Theory:  Self-Determination Theory (SDT)14 is a general theory of human motivation that assumes people are innately motivated toward growth and well-being. It assumes that humans have psychological needs of autonomy (volition or willingness), perceived competence (feeling one has the ability to achieve the desired outcome) and relatedness (warm, positive relationships with important others).  When the social surroundings and health care environment support these needs, people develop greater levels of autonomous self-regulation, perceived competence, and relatedness and internalize the value of behaving in healthier ways. SDT has been widely applied to the domains of education, business, parenting, and health. Personal autonomy, perceived competence and an individual’s assessment of the value of health are all patient-centered variables, defined by the individuals, and thus interventions that work by increasing these factors are patient-centered by definition. A recent correlational meta-analysis has supported the SDT Model for Health Behavior Change in 184 data sets with over 13,000 subjects.10 Over 30 of these studies involve predicting levels of physical activity, and several others involve weight loss and healthy nutritional intake. There are 10 randomized controlled trials that support this model including several in physical activity, weight loss and nutritional outcomes.15-19 There is robust evidence that the health outcomes achieved in SDT interventions are explained (mediated) by significant increases in patients’ autonomous motivation and perceived competence; therefore we will also assess these constructs in the current proposal.
In our previous work, our participants have endorsed the use of SDT constructs as the framework for our work. They repeatedly express the benefits they have attained (or seen others achieve) from participation which resonate with SDT. For example, consistent with an autonomy supportive climate, participants highly valued the support they received from others to discover new options or choices for healthy living. Consistent with the SDT principle of perceived competence, our former HLP participants commented that finding ways to build confidence about physical activity is vital to remaining motivated to continue to stay active.

RE-AIM:  RE-AIM is an evaluation framework used to assess public health impact that measures five critical implementation factors: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.  These dimensions are all highly relevant to our efforts to determine the best interventions to increase physical activity and improve nutrition among under-resourced communities.  While SDT will enable us to measure factors thought to be causal in behavior change, RE-AIM will help us to compare how well our two interventions meet the needs of our target communities and our stakeholders. Since our primary interest is in the adaptation of the DPP for specific communities, these assessments will be critical to determining the external validity and potential for dissemination of our work. RE-AIM is well-conceived for measuring these dimensions in programs that seek to support behavior change. 
2.	How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)? 
In this project, we apply SDT in specific ways by informing: 1) the design, 2) the training of the team members to promote competence, relatedness, and autonomy, 3) the intervention curriculum to promote participant motivation by supporting their needs for competence and autonomy, and 4) use of validated measures from SDT to determine if motivation (autonomy and perceived competence) is enhanced and correlated with behavior change. 

RE-AIM will keep the project oriented towards a implementation perspective and enable us to think through each of the dimensions as we implement the project.  It is also a useful framework to emphasize the importance of context and real world applicability of the work. In addition to providing a framework for evaluation, it also provided a framework for adaptation of the evidence based intervention.  

Assignment #3b - Measures & Evaluations:
1.	What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
Participant assessments will consist of self-report (survey) questions (demographics, Dietary Risk Assessment, Physical Activity Assessment Tool, Subjective Vitality Scale, Satisfaction questions, Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire,8,9 Perceived Competence Scale,10 The Modified Health-Care Climate Questionnaire8,9), objective assessments of physical activity (accelerometer or pedometer), and biometric (fitness and weight) measures. Assessments will be administered using study iPads at four time points: baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks (post-completion of HLP intervention group), six months (post completion of initial DPP), and one year. A research assistant will administer all study measures.
In addition, we will measure the Subjective Vitality Scale, Satisfaction questions, and Perceived Competence Scale to the group leaders at the project sites.  This will contribute to our understanding of the organizational impact of the interventions.
2.	What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
We will measure and report all five dimensions of the RE-AIM model to evaluate Reach (proportion and representativeness of the target population that participates) to the intended target population, Effectiveness (positive outcomes minus negative outcomes), Adoption (proportion of settings that adopt the study) by target settings, Implementation (fidelity to program and assessment of unintended consequences), and Maintenance of intervention effects in individuals and settings over time. www.re-aim.org)11,12
 
3.	Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not? 
We will measure a number of parameters of well-being and vitality (see SDT instruments above) among participants and the group leaders.  In addition, in assessing the impact of the intervention on the sites, we will observe any organizational changes that might occur as a result of participation in the study.

For example, consistent with an autonomy supportive climate, participants highly valued the support they received from others to discover new options or choices for healthy living. Consistent with the SDT principle of perceived competence, our former HLP participants commented that finding ways to build confidence about physical activity is vital to remaining motivated to continue to stay active.<br /><br />RE-AIM:  RE-AIM is an evaluation framework used to assess public health impact that measures five critical implementation factors: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.  These dimensions are all highly relevant to our efforts to determine the best interventions to increase physical activity and improve nutrition among under-resourced communities.  While SDT will enable us to measure factors thought to be causal in behavior change, RE-AIM will help us to compare how well our two interventions meet the needs of our target communities and our stakeholders. Since our primary interest is in the adaptation of the DPP for specific communities, these assessments will be critical to determining the external validity and potential for dissemination of our work. RE-AIM is well-conceived for measuring these dimensions in programs that seek to support behavior change. <br />2.	How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)? <br />In this project, we apply SDT in specific ways by informing: 1) the design, 2) the training of the team members to promote competence, relatedness, and autonomy, 3) the intervention curriculum to promote participant motivation by supporting their needs for competence and autonomy, and 4) use of validated measures from SDT to determine if motivation (autonomy and perceived competence) is enhanced and correlated with behavior change. <br /><br />RE-AIM will keep the project oriented towards a implementation perspective and enable us to think through each of the dimensions as we implement the project.  It is also a useful framework to emphasize the importance of context and real world applicability of the work. In addition to providing a framework for evaluation, it also provided a framework for adaptation of the evidence based intervention.  <br /><br />Assignment #3b - Measures &amp; Evaluations:<br />1.	What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?<br />Participant assessments will consist of self-report (survey) questions (demographics, Dietary Risk Assessment, Physical Activity Assessment Tool, Subjective Vitality Scale, Satisfaction questions, Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire,8,9 Perceived Competence Scale,10 The Modified Health-Care Climate Questionnaire8,9), objective assessments of physical activity (accelerometer or pedometer), and biometric (fitness and weight) measures. Assessments will be administered using study iPads at four time points: baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks (post-completion of HLP intervention group), six months (post completion of initial DPP), and one year. A research assistant will administer all study measures.<br />In addition, we will measure the Subjective Vitality Scale, Satisfaction questions, and Perceived Competence Scale to the group leaders at the project sites.  This will contribute to our understanding of the organizational impact of the interventions.<br />2.	What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?<br />We will measure and report all five dimensions of the RE-AIM model to evaluate Reach (proportion and representativeness of the target population that participates) to the intended target population, Effectiveness (positive outcomes minus negative outcomes), Adoption (proportion of settings that adopt the study) by target settings, Implementation (fidelity to program and assessment of unintended consequences), and Maintenance of intervention effects in individuals and settings over time. www.re-aim.org)11,12<br /> <br />3.	Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not? <br />We will measure a number of parameters of well-being and vitality (see SDT instruments above) among participants and the group leaders.  In addition, in assessing the impact of the intervention on the sites, we will observe any organizational changes that might occur as a result of participation in the study.";s:6:"parent";N;s:7:"replies";a:0:{}s:4:"show";b:1;s:3:"cid";s:32:"6e94c4a3653bf1a134dbb739e71c715a";}s:32:"aaeabf146bdc99e559e7e752b8c5700a";a:8:{s:4:"user";a:5:{s:2:"id";s:10:"boldenburg";s:4:"name";s:15:"Brian Oldenburg";s:4:"mail";s:25:"boldenburg@unimelb.edu.au";s:7:"address";s:0:"";s:3:"url";s:0:"";}s:4:"date";a:1:{s:7:"created";i:1538004785;}s:3:"raw";s:1439:"ASSIGNMENT 3A
I really like the theories/models you are proposing to use and I do very much like your explicit focus on understanding more about the implementation process and to evaluate two implementation strategies. I cannot recall whether you might have already done this, however, have you gone through a formal Intervention Mapping (or similar) process as developed by Kok, Parcel and colleagues? Related to this, have you prepared a logic model that specifies all of the different variables from implementation through to change in outcomes variables, so that you can then explicitly map these on to the different theories/models?

ASSIGNMENT 3B
As I have said in response to your ASSIGNMENT 3A, preparing a logic model that maps your intervention to its hypothesized effects on process, impact and outcome variables will also be a very useful way of ‘validating’ whether you have got all of the relevant variables and measures covered. Finally, with your kind of intervention, it is also good to think about whether there might be any unintended positive/negative outcomes or consequences that might not be predicted by previous research and/or the theories/models you are using. And even if you cannot specify these in advance, it is a good idea to make sure you undertake some key informant interviews or think of some other methodology that might help capture such outcomes. 

Overall though, this is really excellent work.

While I agree that SDT is a good model for your core intervention and RE-AIM is good as an evaluation model or framework, perhaps you should also think about what models/theories might also be good to understand more explicitly the implementation process. Such models can also help inform your measures and many other details of your research methodology and intervention implementation.

I have two comments here. As I have just said in my previous comments, you probably need to think a bit more deeply about the implementation process and this will then help you be more specific about the measures you could use to evaluate the different dimensions of the RE-AIM framework. In your response to the question about co-benefits, it’s good to say that you will measure “organizational changes”.

Apologies for the delay in following up on your progress.  I am sorry to hear about the grant that was not supported.  It's great to see that you will continue the work using another evidence-based approach with inadequate uptake, Medication Therapy Management.  Sometime prior to the in-person meeting, I think it will be helpful for you to go back through the previous two assignments to think about MTM from the perspective of those initial questions.  I am not very familiar with MTM and had a chance to do just a little background reading on it.  How does MTM align with business models of most pharmacies?  Is MTM something that pharmacists would like to implement; are they asking for it?  Will the MTM be targeted to a diabetes population or general pharmacy users?  
It's great that you plan to use the i-PARiHS framework in your revised work. In terms of comparing integration versus capacity-building implementation strategies, are there specific models that you plan to use for this?  In terms of measuring process, you may be able to measure change in barriers and facilitators as well as to what extent the implementation occurs as planned.  I think it would be good to get additional consultation on this from Lisa Saldana.  She is currently conducting a project where she will be able to understand fidelity to the implementation model as well as fidelity to intervention.  Other prevention implementation researchers have considered this, too.  Another factor might be understanding to what extent pharmacists are making adaptations to MTM during the implementation process. 
Unintended consequences would be learning that implementation produced unexpected negative or positive outcomes.  For example the implementation of MTM leading to decreased productivity among pharmacists, which also led to complaints and less follow-up from customers -- an unintended negative consequence.
Let me know if you would like to schedule a follow-up phone call to discuss your plans in more details.  I'd be happy to do that during the latter part of next week.

Have the measures you are proposing to use for your primary and secondary outcomes been validated for SMW populations?  
Does the EPIS framework integrate the assessment of fidelity of the intervention as part of the implementation process?  
Are you addressing issues of engagement of the target population, to be receptive to the inoculation messages, and planning to assess to what extent they are attending to the messages?  Thus, if you build it will they actually use it -- in a research context or a real world context?

First, I want to acknowledge that this is a challenging format to be able to describe all of the many moving parts of your proposal and to recognize that there might be aspects that are not obvious to me, but that you have already considered. 

I think that it will be very important to not just select an appropriate framework, but to map it closely onto these many moving parts. Your use of the CFIR to help define both the characteristics of the churches, but also the individual characteristics is a nice choice; however, it will be critical for you to define how you plan to measure each and to map it discretely onto your framework. Similarly, while it is true that the TDF provides a framework for the multiple (potential) behavioral   change characteristics, there is a very likely possibility that there will be an interaction between what you learn from the TDF and from the CFIR. Your analytic plan will need to be able to account for, and disentangle these interactions. 

I continue to find this project highly innovative with the potential for significant real-world impact. As you proceed, it might be useful to consider what it will "take" to define these multiple moving parts in a way that is not only rigorous (which I think you have done) but replicable (which is less clear). I encourage you to consider how your application will be able to overlay both the intervention framework and the evaluation framework in a way that will be clear, discrete, and digestible for your reviewers. You also note that you are not quite sure yet of the "process." I suspect that this will become more clear as you work through a way to overlay these two parallel needs with one another. 

You have a terrific project and I look forward to seeing how it all comes together. You have established the most difficult part-- the community engagement piece-- and so now it is just a matter of refining a plan that will be replicable for those who are reviewing from the outside.

Thank you for your detailed response. Your use of RE-AIM and the Diffusion of Innovation are both appropriate and complementary. I wonder, however, if you might consider the addition of mixed methods or observational strategies in your evaluation plan. While you propose a very comprehensive use of surveys, it is unclear that this will provide an objective measure of the implementation of these policies and behavior change practices (e.g., what does "level of adoption" mean in terms of assessment?). Student surveys will provide some insight, but it is less clear how you will be able to evaluate if there is a misalignment between student and staff report. It will be unknown if this is a factor of the intervention, of the staff implementation, or of the student acceptance and adoption. 

You note that "The RE-AIM domains will define the outcomes and measures of the study; Reach of the policy, Effectiveness of implementation of the policy to decrease SSB consumption, level of Adoption of the policy, policy Implementation and Maintenance of policy implementation over time. Strategies are chosen to support policy implementation and help overcome barriers to implementation." It will be very important to define HOW this will be accomplished (and this is where I think that mixed methods might be useful). 

Your attention to the unintended consequences of the study is excellent, and an important innovation of your approach. You note that it has been challenging to collect this information in the past and I would encourage you and your team to think this through carefully. As you are aware, there are intervention finances and then there are implementation finances. Given your proposed scale-up across multiple schools, this will be critical to discretely measure. I would be cautious of an "exploratory" approach as suggested, but instead think that you could find a lot of value in selecting key intervention and implementation components from your previous preliminary work, to concretely (rather than in an exploratory way) assess, and then to concretely map these onto policies or strategies that might help overcome the barriers that you note come from this potential financial disincentive (i.e., it will be more valuable to concretely assess and determine the implications of a few big ticket activities, than to try to explore a range of cost and resource uses that are not likely to be driving the barriers you have experienced). 

Finally, as you consider measurement of process, it will be important to include not just the "what" (i.e., adherence) as is suggested by your examples (Did they complete an action plan? Did they attend staff training? Did they provide menus for feedback?) but also the "how" to know that these process implementation activities were completed as intended. This again might be accomplished by a mixed methods or random observational assessment. 

This is a lot to measure and you have an excellent start to mapping this on well to a framework and theory. Once you have this operationalized in a way that will allow you to discretely observe change over time, this will make for a terrific analytic plan. 

Great and important work! Lisa ";s:5:"xhtml";s:3317:"Hi Kathryn<br /><br />Thank you for your detailed response. Your use of RE-AIM and the Diffusion of Innovation are both appropriate and complementary. I wonder, however, if you might consider the addition of mixed methods or observational strategies in your evaluation plan. While you propose a very comprehensive use of surveys, it is unclear that this will provide an objective measure of the implementation of these policies and behavior change practices (e.g., what does &quot;level of adoption&quot; mean in terms of assessment?). Student surveys will provide some insight, but it is less clear how you will be able to evaluate if there is a misalignment between student and staff report. It will be unknown if this is a factor of the intervention, of the staff implementation, or of the student acceptance and adoption. <br /><br />You note that &quot;The RE-AIM domains will define the outcomes and measures of the study; Reach of the policy, Effectiveness of implementation of the policy to decrease SSB consumption, level of Adoption of the policy, policy Implementation and Maintenance of policy implementation over time. Strategies are chosen to support policy implementation and help overcome barriers to implementation.&quot; It will be very important to define HOW this will be accomplished (and this is where I think that mixed methods might be useful). <br /><br />Your attention to the unintended consequences of the study is excellent, and an important innovation of your approach. You note that it has been challenging to collect this information in the past and I would encourage you and your team to think this through carefully. As you are aware, there are intervention finances and then there are implementation finances. Given your proposed scale-up across multiple schools, this will be critical to discretely measure. I would be cautious of an &quot;exploratory&quot; approach as suggested, but instead think that you could find a lot of value in selecting key intervention and implementation components from your previous preliminary work, to concretely (rather than in an exploratory way) assess, and then to concretely map these onto policies or strategies that might help overcome the barriers that you note come from this potential financial disincentive (i.e., it will be more valuable to concretely assess and determine the implications of a few big ticket activities, than to try to explore a range of cost and resource uses that are not likely to be driving the barriers you have experienced). <br /><br />Finally, as you consider measurement of process, it will be important to include not just the &quot;what&quot; (i.e., adherence) as is suggested by your examples (Did they complete an action plan? Did they attend staff training? Did they provide menus for feedback?) but also the &quot;how&quot; to know that these process implementation activities were completed as intended. This again might be accomplished by a mixed methods or random observational assessment. <br /><br />This is a lot to measure and you have an excellent start to mapping this on well to a framework and theory.

I find it a little confusing to understand what exactly constitutes "adaptation." The way we've used CHWs in trials in my department is to use them to somewhat tailor the intervention to the individual participant - for example, by deciding whether to focus on diet or PA etc., partly driven by what the participant wants to do. Also, part of doing the intervention in the church setting is so that the church network is mobilized in support of the health behavior change. This is what I was talking about re: adaptation above (e.g. the pastor might check in wiith participants or announce their progress at church, or they might provide a "testimony" in church that would help other people. So does that not really constitute "adaptation"? I guess I have trouble understanding exactly what is an intervention and what is the adaptation, especially for an intervention like CHWs that is not highly scripted/structured.

1.	What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?
Our proposed study design is an Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Design designed to simultaneously compare the effectiveness of our two interventions, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the Healthy Living Program (HLP- an adaptation of the DPP) (Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness the HLP and the DPP) and to study their implementation by peer counselors in community settings (Aim 2: Assess the peer counselors’ fidelity to the curricula, satisfaction, motivation, and ability to sustain their volunteer roles.)  As part of the study of the comparative effectiveness of the two interventions, we will also assess autonomy and competence as explanatory variables for behavior change (Aim 3: Assess the extent to which participant outcomes are predicted by measures of autonomy and competence).  To assess the feasibility and utility of the implementation strategy, we will employ a mixed methods process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework (Aim 4).  
I am struggling to determine if this design is a Hybrid 1 or 2 design.  Since we are not comparing implementation strategies but rather testing a single implementation strategy with two different preventive interventions, I lean towards Type 1, but we are certainly attempting to understand the implementation strategy strengths and barriers and its potential impact on outputs and outcomes.  This hybrid design seems most appropriate since the effectiveness of each program in this setting and under these conditions has yet to be determined.  The ability to implement these programs and assess their value in our target populations – potentially comparing their success across different populations and settings - would advance the field much more rapidly than an effectiveness study.  We believe the design is feasible, appropriate to the population (based on community input), and ethically sound,  
2.	Will you be incorporating a mixed methods design into your study? If so, what approach will you use to incorporate the qualitative data into the study (e.g., integrate the quantitative and qualitative data to inform your aims? If not, why?
We will employ a mixed methods design into the evaluation of the implementation strategy using the RE-AIM framework.   Each dimension of RE-AIM will be assessed through both quantitative and qualitative approaches.  For example, Reach will be assessed by calculating the percent of people approached to participate who choose to participate, how representative of the target population they are, and the numbers excluded and for what reasons.  However, we will also interview non-participants and participants for their insights regarding the value of the program and barriers/incentives to participation.  We would approach all dimensions in a similar manner.  Our purpose would be to understand the value (pros and cons) of the implementation strategy and to develop the information necessary to modify it if needed.  This framework, although targeting the implementation, will also inform our findings regarding the comparative effectiveness of the programs.
We will conduct concurrent/convergent quantitative and qualitative data collection to the extent possible.  We currently plan a fixed design but if an emergent issue develops, we would alter the design.  The points of interface would include data collection, data analysis and interpretation, and most likely, reporting of outcomes.

1.	What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?
We are planning to conduct a hybrid type 2 pilot study to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of utilizing a CHW in the church setting to address uncontrolled hypertension among church members. We will use a mixed methods design. To measure effectiveness of the intervention our primary outcome will be change in blood pressure over the 6 months of the intervention. We have data on blood pressure for the participants of the study that was collected in Spring of 2018. We will measure change in blood pressure from Spring, 2018 to baseline of the current study (January 2019) and then from the study baseline to the end of the study (July 2019). We will assume that a greater rate of improvement in BP over the study period than over the pre-study period will indicate that the intervention was effective in reducing BP. We can also randomize individuals within each church to intervention or waitlist control and conduct the intervention in two waves. This will enable us to compare changes from Spring, 2018, January 2019 and July 2019 in both the intervention arm and a waitlist control. Secondary outcome measures will include electronic pill caps to measure medication adherence which is a key behavioral target of the intervention.
To assess implementation, we will conduct a formative evaluation at the beginning, middle and end of the intervention with church pastors and a subset of participants from each church to determine perceived barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation and to measure Inner Setting influences on the implementation (including leadership engagement, perceived compatibility of the intervention with church values and relative prioritization of the intervention). We will also measure interventionist self-efficacy and beliefs about the effectiveness and appropriateness of the intervention as well as barriers to implementation among CHWs monthly during the intervention period. 
Finally, we will conduct a summative evaluation with CHWs, pastors and a subset of participants to determine barriers and facilitators of intervention implementation.
2.	Will you be incorporating a mixed methods design into your study? If so, what approach will you use to incorporate the qualitative data into the study (e.g., integrate the quantitative and qualitative data to inform your aims? If not, why?
The formative and summative evaluations will include both qualitative and survey tools. We will use results of the formative qualitative interviews to make changes to the intervention during the intervention period. To the extent possible, we will try to address any barriers and enhance facilitators to improve effectiveness of intervention implementation. If there are particular participant-level barriers that are identified by the CHWs and/or pastors or participants (e.g. caregiving burden impairing ability of a participant to engage in the intervention) during the formative evaluation we can measure those in the post-assessment on an individual participant level and include them in quantitative analysis to determine whether they affected intervention effectiveness or implementation (e.g. # CHW visits).

1.	What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?

We will conduct a hybrid type 3 pilot cluster randomized trial (CRT) to compare using an enhanced implementation strategy (Enhanced Replicating Effective Programs:E-REP) versus implementation as usual (IAU) to deliver a school-based health curriculum (the Michigan Model for Health: MMH). IAU is equivalent to using standard REP as current MMH curriculum delivery practices include training, a manual and as-needed technical assistance. Hybrid type 3 designs test an implementation strategy while gathering information on behavioral outcomes. Previous research supports the effectiveness of MMH in reducing youth substance use and the program is widely adopted. Previous research also suggests that the intervention is not implemented with high levels of fidelity in community schools. A logical next step in improving the public health impact of this program is to develop and test an implementation strategy. The hybrid type 3 CRT comparing a new implementation strategy versus IAU is the best design to answer our research questions because it assesses if the enhanced strategy produces better implementation and behavioral (student) outcomes compared to current standard implementation practice.

We will use mixed methods to obtain a comprehensive understanding of using E-REP to deliver the health curriculum. We will collect qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously on our implementation outcomes, including fidelity (quality delivery and adherence), feasibility, acceptability and appropriateness. Results from each data set will be examined side-by-side to explore convergence (i.e., comparing conclusions with each analysis) to investigate if interview data concurs with quantitative results.

Q4a: What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?
I will use the hybrid type 3 approach since I am interested in primarily studying the implementation process, but also expect to evaluate whether the EBP is effective in our community study population. In addition, it will lean toward a pragmatic design as my focus is less on the theory and content of the intervention and much more on the theories of how to encourage adoption of the EBP in our organizations.

Assignment #3a - Design:
1.	What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?
2.	Will you be incorporating a mixed-methods design into your study? If so, what approach will you use to incorporate the qualitative data into the study (e.g., integrate the quantitative and qualitative data to inform your aims? If not, why?

My responses to these questions are… 

1.	I have decided to use a sequential multiple randomized trial (SMART) design (Kilbourne et al., 2014) in my Hybrid Type 2 study (Curran et al., 2013). Based on my readings to date, I believe that the SMART design is the best approach to achieving my study objectives as the literature is increasingly suggesting that single implementation strategies are insufficient for optimizing the integration of evidence-based practices in complex social settings. Furthermore, the majority of the limited number of implementation science projects completed in community pharmacy settings to date have employed single implementation strategies and have not yielded long-term sustained practice change (Rosenthal, 2016). Additionally, this study design accounts for heterogeneity amongst practice settings and will enable the direction of resources where they are most needed and based on evidence of the implementation process over time. As with my originally proposed project, I plan to work with independent community pharmacies who are part of an enhanced services network in the state of Mississippi. Based on some other work that I have conducted with this group I know that they differ greatly with respect to their readiness and ability to implement change within their respective environments. The SMART design will enable my proposed study to more specifically capture differences between the pharmacies that lead to the integration of the intervention or not. 

As I mentioned in my introduction is assignment #3 I have also chosen to employ a Hybrid Type 2 design in recognition of the need to test both the clinical and implementation interventions more completely. 

Tentative aim 1: …to determine, among community pharmacies not initial responding to the dissemination strategy (will continue to work to more clearly define what this strategy will entail), the effect of adaptive implementation strategies that begin with an external facilitator or with an external facilitator plus an internal facilitator on increasing the number of disease management services provided to patients with Type 2 diabetes in 12 months.

Tentative aim 2: …to determine the effect of the afore mentioned adaptive implementation strategies on patient outcomes in patients with Type 2 diabetes in 12 months.

NOTE: I am still working on the aims and going back through the previous assignments given my new plans. 


2.	Given the nature of the measures I am proposing for this study I will be employing an embedded concurrent mix-methods design. I believe that this approach will allow a complete picture of the context of each practice site, as well as the implementation process over the course of the study.

1. What is your proposed study design? Why is that the best design to answer your research questions or hypotheses?
I have decided to change my aims slightly.  Instead of comparing two different methods of training On the Move Instructors, I have decided I first need to compare different types of instructors.  So I am now interested in comparing Health Care Professionals (PTs, OTs, etc) to Group Fitness Instructors. The rationale is that healthcare professionals have greater education and training but are a more expensive option. Group fitness instructors have less education, but are more economical and probably more widely available. If group fitness instructors can deliver the program and get the same outcomes as healthcare providers then it would increase the options for implementation of the program.

Mt trial design will be a Type I hybrid design including a cluster-randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the On the Move program taught by different instrucotrs.  Senior Centers will be randomized to offer the On the Move group exercise program taught by either a Healthcare provider or a group fitness instructor. Both types of instructors will receive the same 12 hours of training and certification in the On the Move Program. The instructor will be responsible for working with the Senior Center to implement the On the Move program. We are randomizing as clusters as only one instructor will be assigned to a center.  Also, if the program was offered at a center and taught by both kinds of instructors there could potentially be contamination (participants may want to attend the other class).Also, we cannot randomize participants to go to a certain center as older adults usually attend the center that is most convenient for them. I will begin to collect information on the implementation process as to how best to implement the On the Move program in Senior Community Centers with real-world providers.  How best to match the instructors with the centers? Finding ways for the centers to be able to fund the program so that it can be sustained in the long-term.

I question if I need to randomize the centers to type of instructor or could I just let things happen as they would in the real world - instructors and centers are matched based on location and convenience.  If I did not randomized and did a quasi-experimental study, I worry that there may be differences in the centers that I am unaware of and do not measure/control for.

2. Will you be incorporating a mixed methods design into your study? If so, what approach will you use to incorporate the qualitative data into the study (e.g., integrate the quantitative and qualitative data to inform your aims? If not, why? 
Yes, I was planning of including both quantitative and qualitative data collection.  Likely the information will be collected concurrently. I am interested in using the qualitative data to help explain the quantitative findings.  For example, if the group fitness instructors could not get the same outcomes as the healthcare providers could I determine why through interviewing the participants and the instructors? Maybe group fitness instructors did not feel confident teaching the class or maybe they did not feel comfortable progressing the exercises or modifying the program.  I could also ask the participants questions about their satisfaction with the class instructor.  I think it would be important to collect the information and the same time instead of concurrently.  I would hate to wait too long to collect the qualitative data as I would be worried that the instructors and participants memory may fade over time.

I will also collect qualitative data on the implementation process to help me develop methodology to implement the On the MOve program on a larger scale.

My responses to these are:

Proposed study design and incorporating mixed methods

The proposed study will utilize a multiphase mixed methods design as informed by the EPIS framework:

1)	In the Exploration and Preparation phase, we are utilizing a simultaneous mixed methods design (qualitative + quantitative). The function of this design is to complement 1) qualitative data of outer and inner contextual factors from key informant interviews among potential adopters of the inoculation messaging intervention (practitioners within LGBTQ healthcare and community-based settings, LGBTQ advocacy organization leaders, and representatives from national-level health agencies) and 2) qualitative from focus group discussions and quantitative data from online surveys and experiments among young adult SMW to adapt existing inoculation messages that will maximize the fit of the intervention with the needs of potential adopters and the target audience of young adult SMW. Elements of outer and inner contextual factors that are relevant for this research include: 1) sociopolitical; 2) funding; 3) advocacy efforts for tobacco control among SMW and other relevant groups; 4) inter-organizational networks; 5) organizational characteristics; and 6) characteristics of decision-makers. The focus group discussions among young adult SMW will focus on the salience of inoculation messages, message appeal, perceived effectiveness, relevance to increasing resilience, and potential unintended negative effects such as message reactance. The quantitative message testing through online surveys and experiments will determine the effects of inoculation messages on young adult SMW participants’ behavioral intentions (smoking initiation or cessation), information processing measures (message argument strength, counterarguing, identification, perception of being the targeted audience), and attitudinal measures (attitudes and beliefs about tobacco companies). Together, the analyses of the qualitative and quantitative data from key informants and young adult SMW will be connected to inform the optimal adaptations to existing inoculation messages and to develop a range of inoculation messages that will be implemented across different practice settings.

2)	In the Implementation phase, we are utilizing a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design. The function of this design is to assess the effectiveness of implementing adapted inoculation messaging intervention on SMW’s intention of smoking initiation (among non-smokers) and smoking cessation (among smokers) while collecting qualitative measures on outer and inner contextual factors that facilitate or impede the implementation process across different LGBTQ organizations and settings. We will include a sequential explanatory mixed methods design (quantitative -> qualitative) whereby a qualitative study to assess the contextual factors of implementation through interviews with organizational leaders, staff, and young adult SMW is embedded within a quantitative randomized controlled trial of the inoculation messaging intervention versus usual care (messages about health effects of smoking targeting general adult audience) among young adult SMW participants recruited through the implementer organizations. The unit of randomization is at the individual level. As described in the earlier assignment, the primary effectiveness outcomes are young adult SMW’s intention of smoking initiation (among non-smokers) and smoking cessation (among smokers). The embedded qualitative study will focus on relevant factors including 1) sociopolitical, 2) funding, 3) interorganizational networks, 4) intervention developments, 5) leadership, 6) organizational characteristics, 7) innovation-values fit, and individual adopter characteristics (i.e., among young adult SMW). Through this hybrid design, we will be able to achieve the dual aims of determining the effectiveness of the adapted inoculation messages among this population in different practice settings and better understand contextual barriers and facilitators for implementation.

I started an answer to you and my browser closed without being saved. I only tell you this in the event that you somehow end up with two similar answers from me!

Another excellent set of responses to the assignment. Well done! This raised some questions for me that you might have already mentioned and I am not remembering, or if not, that you might want to consider. 
1. Is there a reason why you are limiting yourself to a pilot. Given that you have the sites, participant engagement, and some initial data on the effectiveness of the intervention in other contexts, you are well-positioned for a much larger project. What mechanism are you applying under? 
2. I notice that your time-line starts January 2019. Have you already obtained funding for this project? If not, then you will likely need to revise this which might have implications for some of the details. 

Assuming that you are not wedded to these aspects for either funding or practical reasons, then the following comments will hopefully be helpful. If you are already committed to 1 and 2 above, then this will be less helpful. 

First, I think that your choice of a Hybrid 2 is exactly right. Nice work. However, I am wondering about the decision to limit your clinical effectiveness measures to the 6 months of the intervention. If you are able to extend this to measure change in blood pressure over the intervention period, and then for another 6 months post-intervention, this would be a far more compelling test of the effectiveness of the intervention. Without a test of the sustainment of blood pressure change, then it will be unknown if the intervention was truly effective in promoting behavior change and improved adherence, or if the effect is of the interventionst being there "in the moment." 

Second, the availability of BL data from at least a year prior is excellent! What a gem and I am glad that you are going to be able to leverage that. Will it be possible to find out (even if just self-report though more concrete of course it better) what interventions, if any, were received during that period, and also any sort of multiple reads of blood pressure during that period (i am guessing no, but if so that would be terrific). Given that you have this information, I am wondering about your potential randomization it WL-- this seems like it is not necessary unless of capacity or some other sort of logistical reason. If you are interested in picking up outer context factors (e.g., change in policy) and the impact on implementation then I could see the value in randomizing to WL, but I have not see that in your description thus far. 

Have the participants been using the electronic pill caps already and if so, then I could see how that data would work well with a potential WL design. However, this raises a different question for me. Given that you have BL data that you are proposing to draw from, will participants be excluded to those who provided BL data in the past? Regardless of your answer to this, you will want to address either way. 

The implementation outcomes are far less specified here. The assessment of barriers and facilitators is nice, but not really innovative or exciting enough to make this your primary implementation assessment. I would encourage you to look more deeply given that the field overall has spent a lot of time already considering the impact of barriers and facilitators in community settings. I think the more valuable question is how to overcome them. I do note that you plan to modify your intervention throughout the study period based on implementation outcomes-- this has the potential to be very messy. You will want to be sure that this happens in a discrete way so that as you make those adjustments you will know if it is the adjustment that is helping or hindering versus other factors over time (e.g., CHW skill, patient improved health and motivation). I think that it will also be important to specify what standardized measures you are using to assess your implementation outcomes. 

Similarly, it is noted that you will be using mixed methods. I see the qualitative and quantitative data collection, but it is less clear to me how these will be used in a mixed methods format. Will the data be triangulated or combined in any way? You will want to be very clear about the mixed methods being proposed versus just using the two types of data and information independently. 

I am really excited to see how your whole proposal comes together! I also am curious about the limiting to pilot decision-- this is ready for bigger if you are!

Thank you for your response. I am trying to link all of your various previous responses together to knit a clear picture of what you are proposing. Although I do see how an Hybrid 3 is appropriate, I am wondering if there is a reason that you are not selecting a Hybrid 2 given that you are still very interested in the student response to the intervention. It might be overly complicated to get that student data in a reliable way, in which case I totally agree with the Hybrid 3 decision. But I would encourage you to consider that further. 

The mixed methods that you propose seem very well-suited for this project. I am wondering if you are considering conducting qualitative data collection over time? It seems that the responses might be quite different as the policy is being scaled-up within the school. Further, will there be the potential to assess other more concrete environmental context factors to validate the qualitative responses received? Finally, how do you propose to then use the data obtained-- will this be manualized or provided to future schools as helpful hints for implementation, or? 

I look forward to hearing more as this develops!

1.	If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?
We developed a multi-component strategy for implementing the On the Move group exercise program in senior community centers. I selected strategies from the ERIC project (Powell et al, 2015) which have been used by others when implementing group exercise programs. Many of the resources that will be used in the implementation strategy were developed as part of the evidence-based program application. The components of the implementation strategy are as follows:
•	Access new or existing funding – we will help community centers access the Title IIID funding from the Older Americans Act which is available to support evidence-based programs.
•	Centralized technical assistance – we have assembled a group of experts in the On the Move program that are available to provide assistance to both the OTM instructors and the managers of senior centers who would like to offer the program
•	Develop and distribute educational materials – we developed a 12 hour certification course for On the Move instructors. As part of the course and the process, instructors receive a comprehensive manual which thoroughly explains the On the Move program. Sites who obtain an On the Move license also receive a packet of material which will facilitate implementation of the program.
•	Provide ongoing technical assistance – the On the Move team is available through the website and also by email to provide assistance to the instructors and the senior center managers.

Implementation Strategy name: On the Move Resource Team
Actor(s): A group of researchers who developed the On the Move program
Action(s): Provide technical assistance, educational materials, and resources 
Target(s) of the action: senior center managers and OTM instructors
Temporality: Senior center managers contacted 1 month prior to offering the program and OTM instructor contact begins with certification course
Dose: Managers and instructors can reach out to OTM resource team as needed. Helpful tips sent to instructors monthly.
Implementation outcomes affected: reach (how many members participate), effectiveness (mobility), adoption (assess perceptions on the quality and appropriateness of the program, skills needed, feasibility and enthusiasm for the program), implementation (fidelity of the intervention), and maintenance (do the centers continue to offer the program).
Justification: previous assessment of potential needs and barriers  

2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?
We will be implementing the On the Move group exercise program in senior community centers. The managers of the senior centers need to advertise the program and get their members interested in participating in the program. The instructor of the program needs to deliver the program at the center. Our implementation strategies were selected with these two individuals (senior center manager and OTM instructor) in mind. We will provide resources and technical assistance to help the senior center manager obtain funding for the program and to advertise and market the On the Move program to their members. We will provide the training, resources and technical assistance and support for the OTM instructors. This way they will have the resources and information needed to deliver the program.

3.	If your proposed study does not involve selecting implementation strategies but you are evaluating the outcomes of exposure to a program or policy implemented by others (e.g. natural experiment), how will you measure key differences in implementation variation as by time, population, setting/location, dose or content?

1. If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?

Firstly, we identified common barriers and facilitators to policy implementation by conducting literature reviews, surveying key stakeholders including canteen managers and school principals using an adapted validated TDF survey and holding discussions with health promotion staff who have been involved in supporting schools' implementation of a healthy eating policy for a number of years. Secondly, we mapped these barriers to the Behaviour Change Wheel and TDF and identified key behaviour change techniques and implementation strategies to address these. 

The selected implementation strategies are;
i) Involve executive boards (obtaining executive support) - through engagement with school principals and staff via face-to-face meetings, network meetings or telephone.
ii) Conduct educational meetings (training) - through training workshops designed for canteen managers and other school personnel providing education and skill development in food classification based on the policy criteria, canteen stock selection, financial management and change management.
iii) Develop and distribute educational materials - through printed instructional material, editable templates, sample menus, product database, recipe cards etc.
iv) Provide on-going technical assistance - tailored support from health service staff via telephone, email etc to develop local policy implementation action plans, set specific goals, problem solve, and review implementation progress.
v) Audit and provide feedback - menu audits will be conducted and written feedback reports regarding implementation progress towards policy compliance will be provided to both canteen managers and principals.

2. How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?

The implementation strategies are selected to address common barriers to policy implementation in this setting and therefore directly address these, for example, education will be provided to canteen staff on the policy criteria, tools and resources that assist policy implementation will be provided and practice categorising menu items will occur during training workshops. Additionally engagement with school principals will seek to gain their support of the policy and encourage their communication of this to the wider school community. The provision of menu feedback reports and on-going implementation support via telephone/email will provide canteen staff with specific and practical tailored support. Canteen staff will also be encouraged to access the NSW Healthy School Canteen website and resources developed by the NSW Ministry of Health and Department of Education.

3. If your proposed study does not involve selecting implementational strategies but you are evaluating the outcomes of exposure to a program or policy implemented by others (e.g., natural experiment), how will you measure key differences in implementation variation such as by time, population, setting/location, dose or, content?

";s:5:"xhtml";s:3294:"Reilly - Assignment 5 - Implementation Strategies<br /><br />1. If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?<br /><br />Firstly, we identified common barriers and facilitators to policy implementation by conducting literature reviews, surveying key stakeholders including canteen managers and school principals using an adapted validated TDF survey and holding discussions with health promotion staff who have been involved in supporting schools&#039; implementation of a healthy eating policy for a number of years. Secondly, we mapped these barriers to the Behaviour Change Wheel and TDF and identified key behaviour change techniques and implementation strategies to address these. <br /><br />The selected implementation strategies are;<br />i) Involve executive boards (obtaining executive support) - through engagement with school principals and staff via face-to-face meetings, network meetings or telephone.<br />ii) Conduct educational meetings (training) - through training workshops designed for canteen managers and other school personnel providing education and skill development in food classification based on the policy criteria, canteen stock selection, financial management and change management.<br />iii) Develop and distribute educational materials - through printed instructional material, editable templates, sample menus, product database, recipe cards etc.<br />iv) Provide on-going technical assistance - tailored support from health service staff via telephone, email etc to develop local policy implementation action plans, set specific goals, problem solve, and review implementation progress.<br />v) Audit and provide feedback - menu audits will be conducted and written feedback reports regarding implementation progress towards policy compliance will be provided to both canteen managers and principals.<br /><br />2.

They wanted us to change it to blood pressure but we have to develop a whole new intervention for blood pressure. With the first year of funding we collected the health screening data and have money left to pilot a BP intervention but it's not R01 level funding.

Yes, we would have to limit the participation to folks who did the health screening if we used that as the control. I'm not sure at this point what kind of limitation that would be because not sure how recruitment will go. 

I am going to look into the implementation aim and try to be more specific and come up with standardized measures, as you suggest. Also, this is the second time you've asked about how i plan to integrate qualitative and quantitative measures. I need to look into that too.

Thanks for this information about your research design.  In phase 1, Exploration and Preparation Phase, you mention the use of surveys and experiments -- "The quantitative message testing through online surveys and experiments will determine the effects of inoculation messages on young adult SMW participants’ behavioral intentions (smoking initiation or cessation), information processing measures (message argument strength, counterarguing, identification, perception of being the targeted audience), and attitudinal measures (attitudes and beliefs about tobacco companies).  It sounds like you are planning to run a pilot test of the messages in Phase I.  Is that correct? This wasn't clear.  Are there any Phase II design issues that need to be addressed (worked out) in Phase I?  It looks like there will be multiple messages developed and tested through multiple practices. Is that correct?  Do the practices decide which messages to use; will they be expected to use each one for some period of time?  Will the messages be communicated just within the practice settings (e.g., through a face-to-face interaction), or will the practices disseminate the messages to participants through some method like postings within the practice site, posting on a website, social media, or text messages?  In terms of design issues to consider, is it possible that participants randomized to conditions could interact with each other post randomization-- and possibly share information from the intervention condition to non-intervention participants?  If so, how should this be handled in the design used in the Implementation Phase?

1.	If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?

My chosen EBI is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).  The implementation strategies are multifaceted and multilevel, and I chose them based on the barriers to the DPP’s broad implementation in communities, especially under-resourced, diverse communities.  These choices were based on feedback from previous participants and community members, and on previous experiences with the DPP and the Healthy Living Program (HLP) in the community.  

a)	Healthcare settings are not well-suited to implementation of the DPP

Change service site: to community based organizations – churches and community centers (Our previous efforts to implement the DPP in practice settings were not as successful as efforts in community settings).

b)	In under-resourced communities, there are barriers to physical activity (weather, safety, lack of access to gyms, etc.)

Develop adaptation of curriculum to include group physical activity – Healthy Living Program (based on community and participant feedback).

c)	The DPP curriculum is not well-adapted to specific cultural eating patterns.

Curriculum has been adapted to African American and Latino eating patterns (based on community and participant feedback).

d)	The DPP curriculum is not based on a theory of behavior change

Prepare patients/consumers to be active participants: the delivery of the DPP has been adapted using Self-Determination Theory which promotes autonomy, competence and relatedness

e)	The DPP is relatively expensive when delivered by professionals

Create new clinical team and centralize technical assistance by recruiting volunteer community leaders.  This approach requires several other strategies including: identify and prepare new champions by conducting educational meetings; conduct ongoing training through the development of a learning collaborative; develop and implement tools for quality monitoring (fidelity).

f)	The DPP curriculum is relatively static

Obtain and use patient/consumer feedback to purposely re-examine the implementation 

2.	 How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?

The specific implementation strategies are linked to the setting for this study – inner city and rural under-resourced diverse communities.  The primary overarching strategy is adaptation of the EBI – the DPP – to these settings.  The adaptations include adding a physical activity component due to the likelihood that participants in these communities do not have ready access to physical activity venues and opportunities.  This adaptation, the HLP, will be specifically studied by comparing its outcomes it to the traditional DPP.  Other adaptations, implementation strategies, will be studied through participant feedback, group leader feedback, fidelity to the programs, sustainability, cost, etc.  specifically using the RE-AIM framework.  We hope to develop new information regarding specific approaches to different settings.

thank you for raising these thoughtful questions for the design and to elaborate on how Phase 1's results will determine the design and execution of Phase 2. 

Based on your questions, I wonder if I should restructure this study differently to include a Phase 1.5 with another round of key informant interviews with adopter organization leaders to finalize the most appropriate specific messages and delivery channels (i.e., in-person, print, texting, or social media) that will be used by each implementer organization. Each organization will be able to utilized multiple messages from the range of messages that are piloted tested in Phase 1 and to use multiple channels to disseminate to participants. The messages and channels used will be documented prior to conducting Phase 2 implementation. We are trying to maximize the fit between the intervention (inoculation messages) with the organization characteristics but I can see that this runs the risk of heterogeneity of the intervention being implemented across different organizations. However, we are conceptualizing the core ingredient of the intervention to be the inoculation theme (highlighting the tobacco industry's deceptive practices among LGBT community). The range of messages developed and tested in Phase 1 would all be based on this theme (versus the usual care control messages of health effects of smoking). The specific delivery channels used are not considered part of the core ingredient of the intervention. 

Phase 2 design issues you raised - organizations will determine which inoculation messages to use for their setting. The participants enrolled within each organization will be randomly assigned to receive either the inoculation or usual care message conditions (e.g., via texting or social media). It is possible participants may share the inoculation message with other SMW in their social network and diminish the observed differences (e.g., retweeting the message to their online social network) as you pointed out if they shared the message with SMW who are in the control condition. We could assess participants' exposure to the inoculation message at the end of the follow-up period to determine whether treatment contamination occurred. Or would you recommend utilizing a quasi-experimental interrupted time series approach as an alternative (e.g., first implement the usual care message for a period of 6 months, followed by a period of no messages, and then a period of the inoculation message for 6 months)? There are advantages to this design because additional delivery channels would be available for dissemination of the inoculation messages (e.g., posting on the organization's website, official social media account of the organization). Conversely, this is a weaker design with a different set of limitations compared with the randomized experiment design.

1.	If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?

Our study will focus on applying Enhanced Replicating Effective Programs (E-REP). REP is a multicomponent implementation strategy focused on maximizing flexibility and fidelity in EBI delivery. REP is based on the CDC’s research-to-practice framework, and guided by Social Cognitive and Diffusion of Innovations Theories. Standard REP includes three primary components: program packaging, provider training, and technical assistance. It is a low intensity strategy whose components are consistent with intervention delivery in many community settings. Researchers have enhanced-REP (E-REP) by adding tailoring of program packaging and training to improve fit with local needs and capacity and implementation facilitation. Implementation facilitation (i.e. Facilitation) is a promising strategy from the integrating Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (iPARIHS) framework that provides ongoing, individualized assistance for program delivery. Facilitation is a flexible strategy that can be tailored to address implementation barriers related to the context, innovation, recipient (i.e., student), or provider (i.e., teacher). Facilitation applies principles of interactive problem solving with practice-based knowledge to support teachers as they engage in program delivery. 

We selected REP because it is well suited for implementing the school-based health curriculum that is the focus of the study. The health curriculum, the Michigan Model for HealthTM: MMH, already includes a curriculum manual, teacher training, and a technical assistance process. Our preliminary research with high school health teachers indicates that additional tailoring of REP components is needed to enhance the user-friendliness of the manual, and usefulness of the training. Our preliminary research also indicates that teachers experience multiple- and varied- barriers to implementation. Implementation facilitation can aid in addressing these barriers. The State of Michigan is well-suited to using Facilitation for evidence-based intervention (EBI) delivery due to its network of Regional School Health Coordinators (RSHCs). RSHCs are professionals who promote the health and safety of youth and families using evidence-based approaches. The Michigan School Health Coordinators Association (MiSHCA) works closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) to provide access to and resources for school health programs, such as MMH. MiSHCA makes available an existing infrastructure and capacity for using Facilitation to support health teachers in delivering MMH with fidelity that is sustainable.

2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?

Part of implementation facilitation is using an integrated set of implementation science-informed activities or strategies in which facilitators choose specific activities based on local needs; implementation facilitation can involve using other implementation strategies to meet the needs of the intervention, provider and context. Using an approach like concept mapping can help with identifying factors that are likely to influence implementation (i.e., barriers) as it is informed by input from a range of stakeholders. This approach would also help with identifying specific implementation-science informed strategies that can be employed as part of facilitation. Once factors are identified, stakeholders would collaboratively generate a list of discrete strategies that could both effectively address specific barriers and be feasibly used in a given setting.

Our preliminary research with high school health teachers indicates that additional tailoring of REP components is needed to enhance the user-friendliness of the manual, and usefulness of the training. Our preliminary research also indicates that teachers experience multiple- and varied- barriers to implementation. Implementation facilitation can aid in addressing these barriers. The State of Michigan is well-suited to using Facilitation for evidence-based intervention (EBI) delivery due to its network of Regional School Health Coordinators (RSHCs). RSHCs are professionals who promote the health and safety of youth and families using evidence-based approaches. The Michigan School Health Coordinators Association (MiSHCA) works closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) to provide access to and resources for school health programs, such as MMH. MiSHCA makes available an existing infrastructure and capacity for using Facilitation to support health teachers in delivering MMH with fidelity that is sustainable.<br /><br />2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?<br /><br />Part of implementation facilitation is using an integrated set of implementation science-informed activities or strategies in which facilitators choose specific activities based on local needs; implementation facilitation can involve using other implementation strategies to meet the needs of the intervention, provider and context. Using an approach like concept mapping can help with identifying factors that are likely to influence implementation (i.e., barriers) as it is informed by input from a range of stakeholders. This approach would also help with identifying specific implementation-science informed strategies that can be employed as part of facilitation. Once factors are identified, stakeholders would collaboratively generate a list of discrete strategies that could both effectively address specific barriers and be feasibly used in a given setting. <br /><br />3.	If your proposed study does not involve selecting implementational strategies but you are evaluating the outcomes of exposure to a program or policy implemented by others (e.g., natural experiment), how will you measure key differences in implementation variation such as by time, population, setting/location, dose or, content?<br /><br />n/a";s:6:"parent";N;s:7:"replies";a:0:{}s:4:"show";b:1;s:3:"cid";s:32:"55ba747387b10308e40bd12d9805a124";}s:32:"826718b80127d579d29c51323b64b285";a:8:{s:4:"user";a:5:{s:2:"id";s:9:"rbrownson";s:4:"name";s:13:"Ross Brownson";s:4:"mail";s:19:"rbrownson@wustl.edu";s:7:"address";s:0:"";s:3:"url";s:0:"";}s:4:"date";a:1:{s:7:"created";i:1539966244;}s:3:"raw";s:536:"Hi Andria:
Thanks for your excellent summary. You’re on track related to the design. Do you really need to conduct the hybrid III study or are you ready for a D&I study with no effectiveness measures? These days, people sometimes default to a hybrid design when not needed.
To be sure that you fully address all mixed methods issues, take a look at the Palinkas chapter in our book or other readings from Palikas or Creswell. In addition to the theme of convergence, you could emphasize complementarity of your data.
Nice work!!

Your design makes sense. Since it is a hybrid I study, reviewers will zoom in on your effectiveness outcomes, which logically follow from your design. You have nailed a key issue, the variability in instructors. It might be worth thinking about how you best standardize their backgrounds, passion, and training. Related to your trainers, you might consider some version of the grit scale, which is showing importance in predicting success in counseling. If you don’t know this literature, shoot me an email (rbrownson@wustl.edu) and I’ll send you some articles. If you can standardize the training, passion of the trainers then you could randomly assign them + track some process data on things like training satisfaction. Another issue, to you have enough centers involved to make the randomization effective (offsetting selection bias)?
For the mixed methods question, it is worth considering whether you will truly do a mixed methods design or simply use multiple (QUAL/QUAN) methods. The Palinkas chapter in our book is excellent for some guidance.
Good luck!!

My responses to these questions are… 
Hello again,
I had a really great conversation with my mentor last week and it helped me to further narrow down and focus my proposed project. Rather than proposing a trial right away my first aim will now be to pilot test a previously developed educational program to assist pharmacists in providing more medication therapy management (MTM) services within their pharmacies. My second aim will be to simultaneously identify barriers and facilitators to implementation, while measuring the fidelity to the education program. 
The primary objective of this pilot study will be gain insight into which additional implementation strategies might be useful to the pharmacists to develop a trial wherein these additional implementation strategies are introduced to the pharmacies as needed through a SMART Trial applying a Hybrid Type 3 approach. Within this trial information about the culture, climate, leadership, practice environment, and pharmacists’ attitudes and behaviours will be collected to identify the mechanisms leading to either success in increasing the number of MTM services through the introduction of the educational program, or the mechanisms that lead to the need for additional implementation strategies. With the identification of these mechanisms resource allocation for the scale-up and spread of this strategy for improving the delivery of MTM services can be made as efficient as possible. 
My plan for the coming weeks is to further flush out the aims and justification for the pilot test of the educational program, with the intention of submitting it to an R21 opportunity. This last week hasn’t gone according to plan, and I have not had as much time as I would like to work on this, but I have cleared a few other major projects off of my plate and will have more dedicated time to this project going forward. Thank you again for all of your insights and patience as I work through these ideas.

1.	 Using the nine categories of implementation strategies as a guide I first plan to “conduct ongoing training” (5. train/educate stakeholders) for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to implement a higher number of MTM services using a previously developed program. Once this program training has taken place and pharmacists and technicians are implementing their learning I also plan to “identify barriers and facilitators” (1. evaluation and iterative strategies) to success, as well as measure fidelity to the educational program. 
2.	I am not sure if I am interpreting this question correctly, but I would justify the use of these particular strategies by harkening back to previously conducted studies around the implementation of clinical services within the community pharmacy setting. In particular studies that have focused on why community pharmacists are not actively providing these services one of the barriers often identified is lack of training in how the services could be integrated into normal pharmacy workflow. I believe that an educational program could address this particular issue. Furthermore, much of this previous work has been done with pharmacists who are not currently providing the services. I believe that the barriers they face once they begin to provide the services may change, hence the need to identify new barriers and facilitators. Finally, understanding fidelity to the educational program will be useful in further understanding the facilitators and barriers identified by the pharmacists and inform the next steps of this project. (Please let me know if I have missed the boat on what this question was asking)

My responses to these are:

Through the Exploration and Preparation phase of the study, we will obtain formative data through key informant interviews with potential adopters of the inoculation messaging intervention (practitioners within LGBTQ healthcare and community-based settings, LGBTQ advocacy organization leaders, and representatives from national-level health agencies) to identify contextual characteristics of each adopter organization, barriers, and facilitators for implementing the inoculation intervention. Based on these data, we will next tailor the specific implementation strategies that are most appropriate for these different practice settings to address these contextual factors. 

For example, the California LGBTQ Partnership is an organization that focuses on countering the tobacco industry’s impact on the LGBTQ community through public health education and advocacy. Specific contextual factors include strong leadership support and content expertise on countering tobacco marketing influences among LGBTQ populations due to their organizational mission, existing local and state coalitions for conducting public health education and advocacy, and lack of funding for conducting outreach to increase awareness of emerging trends of tobacco industry practices targeting LGBTQ populations. These important factors influence the decisions about implementation strategies for the inoculation intervention. In this instance, we would focus the implementation strategies on education strategies (creating new health education materials) and financial strategies (seeking new funding to conduct public outreach using the inoculation messages). 

As another example, the Institute for LGBTQ Health Equity is the education, research, and community engagement arm of Equitas Health, a non-for-profit community-based healthcare system with 17 offices in 11 cities serving over 67,000 individuals annually in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The Institute develops and delivers LGBTQ culturally competent healthcare education and training, engaging with LGBTQ and HIV-positive patients, working with community-based organizations, and supporting LGBTQ health research efforts in these regions. Important contextual factors include strong expertise and institutional and health providers’ capacity in addressing HIV treatment, prevention, and sexual health and culturally competent healthcare. However, there is lower awareness and readiness for integrating interventions to reduce tobacco use and tobacco-related health disparities within the practices. In this instance, we would focus the implementation strategies on planning strategies (e.g., obtain leadership, clinicians, and staff buy-in for the inoculation intervention), education strategies (e.g., provide technical assistance and training for clinician and staff on utilizing the anti-smoking inoculation intervention), and restructure strategies (e.g., modifying workflow to flag patients who are current smokers to providers).

1.	If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?

The following are the key implementation strategies we will be focusing on. The first set of strategies addresses the barrier of trust in the population and the second sets of strategies address documented barriers to CHW performance which are respect and recognition within both the healthcare system and the community.

1.	Train church members to serve as “Health Advisors” (community health workers) in churches. This happens prior to participant recruitment and initiation of clinical intervention. This strategy is designed to provide greater access to health services to a disadvantaged population with low trust of medical settings.
a.	Change service site. The CHW will be based out of the church rather than out of a clinic. This means that participants are recruited from the church based on blood pressure screenings and the CHW meets with them in the church setting. 
b.	Recruit, designate and train CHWs. CHWs will be recruited from the churches by the research-community partnership (West Side Alive). The academic institution will interview, select and train the CHWs. Measure: number of applicants for CHW position.
c.	Create new clinical teams. CHWs will work with social workers, navigators and physicians at the academic institution to provide care for participants at the churches. Measure: engagement of physician, navigator and social workers (number of meetings attended, self-reported engagement with project)

2.	Support CHWs to provide effective self-management education to participating church members. These implementation strategies are designed to overcome a key barrier to CHW performance that has been identified in the literature: lack of supervision, support and acknowledgement from the healthcare system. 
a.	Provide clinical supervision. CHWs will meet with the project physician on a bi-weekly basis to review cases throughout the 6 month intervention period. CHWs will also meet with social workers as needed to learn how to address participant social needs. Measure: number of cases assessed, satisfaction of CHW that they are getting necessary support. 
b.	Audit and provide feedback. CHW-participant visits will be recorded, transcribed and reviewed by study staff and feedback will be provided to CHWs. This will occur once per CHW in the first month and bi-monthly thereafter. If problems are identified, this will occur more frequently until problems are resolved. Measure: number of audits performed and feedback given. 
c.	Facilitate relay of clinical data to providers. All participants will be given home blood pressure monitors which upload BP data to a research server. This will allow the CHWs to understand whether BP is improving. Measure: Number of blood pressure readings uploaded by participants. 

3.	Enhance performance of CHWs by increasing visibility and perceived importance of the program within the church setting. 
a.	Identify and prepare champions within the churches. Identify and prepare an individual in church leadership (ideally, the pastor) who dedicate themselves to supporting, marketing, and driving through an implementation, overcoming indifference or resistance that the intervention may provoke in an organization. The church champion will be responsible for making announcements in church and church bulletin that recognize progress in intervention participants. If the champion is not the pastor, this person encourages/reminds the pastor to mention the program at regular intervals and keeps the pastor abreast of program developments. Measure: qualitative interviews (described above) of CFIR Inner Setting constructs, number of announcements in bulletin and church and other church-wide communications. 
		

2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?
In thinking about this question I discovered the Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions (CICI) framework (Pfadenhauer, 2017) which I found helpful for thinking about the aspects of the intervention context that might influence implementation of this intervention. The CICI describes a number of domains of context that might influence implementation, including geographical, socio-economic, socio-cultural, epidemiological and political. What stands out about the context of our proposed intervention is that it is taking place on the West Side of Chicago which is a segregated, impoverished area of the city with high levels of violence, chronic disease and drug use and overdose. In fact, the four (officially recognized) community areas that make up the West Side are among the top ten most violent community areas in the city (Chicago is made up of 77 community areas). In addition, opioid-related deaths and drug overdoses are significantly higher in this area of the city than elsewhere. In addition, the political climate in Chicago is extremely racially-charged. For example, the events leading up to the recent trial of the officer who shot Laquan McDonald included a cover up by the mayor and led to the resignation of the Police Commissioner and the State’s Attorney, and the decision by the mayor (Rahm Emmanuel) not to run for re-election. Laquan McDonald was from the West Side as was Bettie Jones, another woman who was killed by police. Both of these stories were national and the pastors in our churches were heavily involved in representing the families of the victims in both incidents as well as organizing protests throughout the city. They were also involved, with other pastors, in committees to address police reform. Therefore, despite high levels of cardiovascular disease risk factors, the pastors and other community leaders have a number of acute issues that they regularly have to address, and they are serving as representatives of their communities, often on a national level. This will make it difficult for them to serve as champions of the intervention in the way that is needed to increase participant trust and motivation to participate. In addition, the poverty and emotional stress of living in this area is also likely to influence the ability of participants to engage in healthier lifestyle habits that are necessary for managing their blood pressure. This, in turn, could serve to decrease motivation and performance of the CHWs.  

Because all our churches are in this neighborhood we will not be able to compare different intervention contexts. However, our qualitative analysis of CFIR Inner Setting dimensions will hopefully shed light on the mechanisms by which this context might influence implementation. Variation across the pastors and churches in these dimensions may allow us to compare implementation across churches and link implementation outcomes to these contextual factors. 
";s:5:"xhtml";s:7038:"Lynch - Assignment 5<br /><br /><br />1.	If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?<br /><br />The following are the key implementation strategies we will be focusing on. The first set of strategies addresses the barrier of trust in the population and the second sets of strategies address documented barriers to CHW performance which are respect and recognition within both the healthcare system and the community.<br /><br />1.	Train church members to serve as “Health Advisors” (community health workers) in churches. This happens prior to participant recruitment and initiation of clinical intervention. This strategy is designed to provide greater access to health services to a disadvantaged population with low trust of medical settings.<br />a.	Change service site. The CHW will be based out of the church rather than out of a clinic. This means that participants are recruited from the church based on blood pressure screenings and the CHW meets with them in the church setting. <br />b.	Recruit, designate and train CHWs. CHWs will be recruited from the churches by the research-community partnership (West Side Alive). The academic institution will interview, select and train the CHWs. Measure: number of applicants for CHW position.<br />c.	Create new clinical teams. CHWs will work with social workers, navigators and physicians at the academic institution to provide care for participants at the churches. Measure: engagement of physician, navigator and social workers (number of meetings attended, self-reported engagement with project)<br /><br />2.	Support CHWs to provide effective self-management education to participating church members. These implementation strategies are designed to overcome a key barrier to CHW performance that has been identified in the literature: lack of supervision, support and acknowledgement from the healthcare system. <br />a.	Provide clinical supervision. CHWs will meet with the project physician on a bi-weekly basis to review cases throughout the 6 month intervention period. CHWs will also meet with social workers as needed to learn how to address participant social needs. Measure: number of cases assessed, satisfaction of CHW that they are getting necessary support. <br />b.	Audit and provide feedback. CHW-participant visits will be recorded, transcribed and reviewed by study staff and feedback will be provided to CHWs. This will occur once per CHW in the first month and bi-monthly thereafter. If problems are identified, this will occur more frequently until problems are resolved. Measure: number of audits performed and feedback given. <br />c.	Facilitate relay of clinical data to providers. All participants will be given home blood pressure monitors which upload BP data to a research server. This will allow the CHWs to understand whether BP is improving. Measure: Number of blood pressure readings uploaded by participants. <br /><br />3.

Regarding your follow up questions on assignment #4 --

Yes or no on a Phase 1.5 to finalize the messages and delivery channels?  It will be important to have a method for utilizing the key informant interview information to decide on messaging and delivery channels that will be used in the study.  I’m not sure this has to involve another round of interviews, if the first round elicits the needed information, and you have a method to identify messages and delivery channels that rise to the top.  
It should be clear how you intend for organizations to select among the final set of messages, and decide on how they will communicate the messages (e.g., social media, in-person).  

Tailoring and heterogeneity -- It does increase heterogeneity, but if fit is important, it will be important to think about how to handle heterogeneity in your study design.  This is something to discuss with your team, especially your methodologist. 

Thanks for the clarification around the core ingredient, inoculation theme.  Thus, exposure to the inoculation theme (via one of more of the messages) will increase resistance to tobacco industry marketing and decrease intention of smoking initiation and increase intention of smoking cessation.    Is that correct?

Delivery channel is not part of the core ingredient -- Delivery channel may not be part of the core ingredient, but I would recommend tracking this information in some way, to understand how participants were exposed to the messages.

Sorry for the delay in response. I was traveling this week for work. 

Your selection of strategies is spot on. I think that what you have outlined is very appropriate and will support your implementation nicely. For the application, it will be really important to specify each of these further. For instance, the use of audit and feedback is a terrific choice for this project. The reviewers will want to know how frequently audit is done, by what measure of observation (recordings? audio? video? chart reviews?) and how quickly the feedback is provided, as the pace of audit and feedback is important for behavior change. Further the provision of on-going technical assistance very like will include a combination of a "set" of strategies and you will want to be sure to specify them and link them to the outcome they are intended to achieve (e.g., selection of a program champion to achieve steady monitoring and engagement). 

I realize that the context in your schools systems is different than the states, so my examples might not be exactly relevant, but I hope they demonstrate the point I am trying to make. Please let me know if not! 

Nice job and I am glad that we are nearing the end so that I can see how this full concept has come together!

Apologies for the delay. I have been traveling for work this week. 

I greatly appreciate the thinking you are putting into this. In terms of your identification of implementation strategies that will be used-- those are well defined and appropriate. I could imagine that there might be others that would be beneficial for the ongoing monitoring of fidelity, ensuring appropriate recruitment and referrals, etc. My fantasy is that this is going to really take off in this particular church context, and you will want to be clear from the outset that each church has the clear parameters for what "staying on model" looks like, to ensure that there is not an spillover into other populations without a clear way of documenting when this happens. 

But what I am particularly intrigued is how you are considering the outer context and its potential relation to the success of this implementation. That is where I find this truly exciting. I think that you are exactly right that the political and societal context and current climate as the potential to pose barriers. And at the same time, these tensions could be potential significant drivers for health outcomes (e.g., increased stress related to neighborhood tensions). I think that it could be incredibly useful to try and figure out a way to, as accurately as possible, provide an ongoing assessment outer context and the implementation strategies attempted to be used to address changes. I worked on an international project once, where monthly there was a simple Yes/No set of questions for each site around community violence, threats, and lockdowns that might have been imposed. We wanted to track how these impacted the implementation process. You might consider something like that. 

I also could not agree with you more about the pastor being distracted with other important and high profile issues. I would highly recommend pursuing a program champion that is NOT the pastor. This is a consistent theme in my work-- often I am told that the executive director is selected a the champion. This does not work because these folks cannot champion this program specifically when they are championing the agency overall. I think this is parallel to your study. It would be ideal to select someone who has decision-making ability, the ear of the pastor, and the confidence to make the project a priority for the community. 

Great work and looking forward to reading the full concept paper!

1.	If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?
My specific implementation strategies are focused on the lack of awareness of trauma informed approaches for use by non-clinical health programming providers in a vulnerable community. The secondary concern is about the appropriateness of an existing effective non-clinical intervention to reduce psychological distress in health programming providers who may themselves be traumatized and unintentionally traumatizing the communities they serve, meaning there is a mismatch between perception and reality with regard to the effectiveness of their program delivery
Domain	Strategy: CRM Training (Train/educate stakeholders; supporting care providers, and conduct educational outreach type visits; create learning collaborative)
Actor:	Trained CRM Facilitators
Actions: Delivers CRM training
Target of action: Community Based Organization (CBO) programming providers who regularly encounter traumatized community members/program participants
Temporality:	Use of the CRM among CBO providers should begin immediately after the first training concludes.
Dose:	Two different doses are expected based on arm of the intervention: (1) 6 hr training with 1 hr booster sessions at 30, 60, and 90 days; (2) Three 2-hour trainings over 2 weeks, followed by 1 hr booster sessions at 30, 60, and 90 days
Implementation outcomes affected:
-Increased use of CRM skills for self-care
-Increased interest in sharing CRM skills with program clients
-Learning collaborative created with the follow up booster sessions
Justification:
-Having multiple opportunities to practice stress-management skills is critical to continued use and improved health outcome, as suggested in mindfulness literature
- Providing traditional services without addressing specific social contexts can reduce effectiveness of interventions
2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?
Our implementation strategies have been identified because of the community participatory approach we have used with introducing the CRM in the Flint community thus far. In assignment 3, I noted the various ways that our community context has driven interest in using community-based and non-clinical psychological distress reduction interventions, and particularly the struggles of families coping with the continued fallout of the Flint Water Crisis atop a history of complex stressors. Our families are taxed by the availability of local resources, and our providers, even those non-clinical, have become responsible for the mental health of many of their clients and especially to not create additional unintentional traumatic experiences for them. 
3.	If your proposed study does not involve selecting implementational strategies but you are evaluating the outcomes of exposure to a program or policy implemented by others (e.g., natural experiment), how will you measure key differences in implementation variation such as by time, population, setting/location, dose or, content?
Our study does involve specific implementation strategies, but considering my other community efforts still invite community residents to learn the CRM skills, we will be evaluating, over time, whether the number of people interested in using/learning these skills increases, and we will evaluate the extent to which different/additional community organizations invite the trained CRM facilitators to provide training for their staff and clients (as they see fit).

The secondary concern is about the appropriateness of an existing effective non-clinical intervention to reduce psychological distress in health programming providers who may themselves be traumatized and unintentionally traumatizing the communities they serve, meaning there is a mismatch between perception and reality with regard to the effectiveness of their program delivery<br />Domain	Strategy: CRM Training (Train/educate stakeholders; supporting care providers, and conduct educational outreach type visits; create learning collaborative)<br />Actor:	Trained CRM Facilitators<br />Actions: Delivers CRM training<br />Target of action: Community Based Organization (CBO) programming providers who regularly encounter traumatized community members/program participants<br />Temporality:	Use of the CRM among CBO providers should begin immediately after the first training concludes.<br />Dose:	Two different doses are expected based on arm of the intervention: (1) 6 hr training with 1 hr booster sessions at 30, 60, and 90 days; (2) Three 2-hour trainings over 2 weeks, followed by 1 hr booster sessions at 30, 60, and 90 days<br />Implementation outcomes affected:<br />-Increased use of CRM skills for self-care<br />-Increased interest in sharing CRM skills with program clients<br />-Learning collaborative created with the follow up booster sessions<br />Justification:<br />-Having multiple opportunities to practice stress-management skills is critical to continued use and improved health outcome, as suggested in mindfulness literature<br />- Providing traditional services without addressing specific social contexts can reduce effectiveness of interventions<br />2.	How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?<br />Our implementation strategies have been identified because of the community participatory approach we have used with introducing the CRM in the Flint community thus far. In assignment 3, I noted the various ways that our community context has driven interest in using community-based and non-clinical psychological distress reduction interventions, and particularly the struggles of families coping with the continued fallout of the Flint Water Crisis atop a history of complex stressors. Our families are taxed by the availability of local resources, and our providers, even those non-clinical, have become responsible for the mental health of many of their clients and especially to not create additional unintentional traumatic experiences for them. <br />3.	If your proposed study does not involve selecting implementational strategies but you are evaluating the outcomes of exposure to a program or policy implemented by others (e.g., natural experiment), how will you measure key differences in implementation variation such as by time, population, setting/location, dose or, content?<br />Our study does involve specific implementation strategies, but considering my other community efforts still invite community residents to learn the CRM skills, we will be evaluating, over time, whether the number of people interested in using/learning these skills increases, and we will evaluate the extent to which different/additional community organizations invite the trained CRM facilitators to provide training for their staff and clients (as they see fit).";s:6:"parent";N;s:7:"replies";a:1:{i:0;s:32:"0ae259888e497aa2841e57bf3c7449e3";}s:4:"show";b:1;s:3:"cid";s:32:"83534b89f6f341cc2471a17885e6c42d";}s:32:"20e83bda9accccb63448589431efa70c";a:8:{s:4:"user";a:5:{s:2:"id";s:10:"boldenburg";s:4:"name";s:15:"Brian Oldenburg";s:4:"mail";s:25:"boldenburg@unimelb.edu.au";s:7:"address";s:0:"";s:3:"url";s:0:"";}s:4:"date";a:2:{s:7:"created";i:1541279549;s:8:"modified";i:1541279705;}s:3:"raw";s:1752:"Hi Nancy, I really like the way that you are considering the well published and discussed multi-level barriers/challenges to implementation of the DPP. Our team - in collaboration with colleagues in India - have studied these closely because we have been undertaking a trial of diabetes prevention in Kerala in South India for many years and we have also adapted elements of US DPP to that context. I agree its important to examine the curriculum very carefully and to adapt that very carefully to your target population community and context, while obviously ensuring that the adapted curriculum will still achieve the required lifestyle targets for individuals. Additionally, the setting for delivery is very important as are the individuals who will actually delivery the program. While it can be a good idea have community members involved in program delivery, it will be important to carefully define their role and specify the training that will be required for them as well as the long term resources and supports for them with program delivery. I cannot recall whether we have discussed previously, however, I assume you are aware taht there is a voluminous evidence base for involving community members and peer supporters in delivery of diabetes prevention/management programs in US and many other countries, including LMIC contexts.
