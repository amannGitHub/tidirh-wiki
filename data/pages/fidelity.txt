=== Assignment #2: ===
  - Will you be measuring and monitoring the fidelity with which the evidence-based intervention is delivered? If so, how? If not, why not? To what degree is there evidence that associates level of fidelity with individual level outcomes?
  - Will adaptations need to be made to your evidence-based intervention? If so, what aspects might need to be adapted? If applicable, what process would you use to guide those adaptations? Will you be considering how the intervention is likely to be adapted as it is delivered?
