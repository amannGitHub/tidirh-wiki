=== Assignment #5: ===
  -If relevant, what are the specific implementation strategies that you will be focusing on in your proposed research and how have you selected them?
  -How might you link specific implementation strategies to the context in which your work is set?
  -If your proposed study does not involve selecting implementational strategies but you are evaluating the outcomes of exposure to a program or policy implemented by others (e.g., natural experiment), how will you measure key differences in implementation variation such as by time, population, setting/location, dose or, content?
