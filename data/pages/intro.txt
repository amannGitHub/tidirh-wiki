=== Assignment #1a: Draft Specific Aims Page (Due to Small Group August 24, 2018) ===
Draft a specific aims page (2 pages maximum) of your proposed study. Consistent with most well-written D&I-focused specific aims pages, it should generally address the following 5 elements (and questions):
== Health problem == 
  *Why is this health issue a problem, how bad or burdensome is the problem, and why should we be concerned about it?

== Evidence-based practice, program, intervention or guideline == 
  *What do we know works? How effective is this intervention or program? What is the evidence base for it? If additional evidence is needed regarding the effectiveness of the innovation, describe the types of effectiveness data needed (e.g., different populations, settings).

== Dissemination or implementation gap ==
  *Summarize the gap between the existing evidence base and what is being done in practice. What evidence indicates that the intervention, policy, practice, or guideline is not being disseminated or implemented? What are some reasons why it is not being optimally (or at all) disseminated or implemented? What is known about potential barriers or facilitators to successful implementation? Consider whether there is evidence about differential effectiveness across populations, settings, and other contextual factors. If relevant, discuss whether the proposed implementation will consider any potential de-implementation of an existing program or practice.

== Specific Aims (~2-3 aims depending on size and scope of proposed study and funding mechanism) == 
  *State each objective of your proposed study, followed by 2-3 sentences summarizing how you will accomplish the objective, and answer any stated research questions or hypotheses.
  *Your specific aims should include, if possible, information about the population being targeted, context/setting of the proposed study, scope (e.g., number of sites) and timeframe.

==  Importance to field == 
  *Briefly summarize why the proposed study is important to the field, advances our knowledge, and fills a gap in the D&I literature.

Note that your specific aims page does not need to be polished; we are more interested in a brief overview of your proposed study rather than a ‘ready-to-submit’ aims page. If you need examples of specific aims pages, see sample grants available via [[https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/IS/|NCI IS Team site]], sample grants hosted by [[https://impsci.tracs.unc.edu/get-funded/sample-grants/|UNC]] and the [[http://www.biosciencewriters.com/NIH-Grant-Applications-The-Anatomy-of-a-Specific-Aims-Page.aspx|NIH Anatomy of a Specific Aims]] page.

=== Assignment #1b: Brief Overview of Project (needed for small group calls to be scheduled the week of September 4, 2018) === 

Based on feedback from the Specific Aims document, create a 3-5-slide PowerPoint presentation that summarizes your proposed study using the slide deck template provided. During your group call, you will have approximately 5 minutes to present the overview of your study, and approximately 5 minutes for questions, comments, and suggestions.

**For this module your small group facilitators will be organizing a conference call or web meeting for you to practice giving your Elevator Pitch and for you to hear the work of your peers. This will occur the week of September 4th.**
