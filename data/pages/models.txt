=== Assignment #3a - Models: === 
  -Which model or combination of models is most applicable to your proposed study and why?
  -How might your selected model(s) guide or inform other aspects of your study (e.g., hypotheses, measures, outcomes, processes, selection of strategies, etc.)? 
=== Assignment #3b - Measures & Evaluations: ===
  -What outcomes (both clinical/system/public health and dissemination/implementation) are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
  -What processes are you measuring in your study, how are you measuring them, and why are you measuring them?
  -Will you be assessing any potential co-benefits or unintended consequences of the implementation? If so, what outcomes will you assess and how will you measure this? If not, why not?
